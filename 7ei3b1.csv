"Net neutrality is not a free market solution. It's a rule imposed on ISP's that tells them how they can or cannot function, how they can provide services to customers, and so on. In a free market system if one wants net neutrality, then they can go with a company that offers it.

That's my devil's advocate position. Even with a serious tag, I can't imagine too many people who are against it would even want to comment, given that it sends so many into a blind rage.","Kind of scared to comment, but I guess I'll just abandon this after I post it.

I do and don't support net neutrality. Reasons for:

* Premiums for types of browsing/usage is absurd
* It would nearly kill the opportunity to start your own website and have effective traffic.
* It could have some SERIOUS repercussions for spreading ideas and startups.
* Freedom of speech
* Could easily lead to corrupt business practices
* Could create nuclear-level monopolies, cementing top tech business (which is what I believe to be the ultimate goal.)
* Would be ***extremely*** difficult to put back in place if removing it does not work.

Why I am against:

* It is objectively unfair to the companies to cover maintenance and rising costs of bandwidth.
* It *could* actually lower costs for consumers
* It *could* create faster internet speeds (GB)
* Premium browsing is *not* guaranteed.

All in all, I think net neutrality needs to change, but not removed. It needs to be weakened for sure.","Something people forget in this debate is that internet is not, and cannot be, free market truly. Fundamentally the internet is a web connecting computers. ISP's are not people who just magically give you connections to other computers, they work together to unify the whole of what we know as the internet. If it was truly free market, then the internet would splinter into smaller versions of the internet that would not communicate with eachother. The reason you don't have choices is because the choices are fundamentally the same thing if they are actually connected to the internet.","I support nn but I can't help but to feel this is just a yearly thing now. Like as long as companies are going to make money when nn gets killed they will keep fighting to get it killed. The only way to make the whole thing stop is to start our own internet company that has national/global coverage that would hold nn even if the government killed it. But the chances of that happening are damn near none :\","A few points off the top of my head.

- I don't want the government micro-managing the internet, which is exactly what will happen when the FCC starts trying to define fairness. Government-mandated ""fairness"" has always come hand in hand with burdensome unintended consequences.

- In addition to opposing government-mandated neutrality rules, I also oppose the current status quo where local governments grant monopoly status to cable ISPs. Net neutrality wouldn't be such a huge issue if people had more options for high-speed internet. Pretty soon there are going to be 5G towers all over the place, and that competition is what will force cable ISPs to provide a product that consumers want.

- Netflix represents 1/3 of all American internet traffic during primetime. The ISPs are handcuffed in their ability to recoup broadband infrastructure costs from Netflix. People are worried about ISPs cutting off users from smaller content providers, but ending net neutrality will mean the biggest consumers of internet bandwidth will be the ones who actually pay the most money.

- It's often difficult to get a reliable stream of popular events, like a *Game of Thrones* premiere or a big football game, because ISPs are not allowed to prioritize the HBO or ESPN traffic during peak demand periods. Millions of consumers are forced to use a service that's worse than it could be, just because the government has said that the alternative is unfair.

Now let the downvotes rain. I ain't scared.","I think Net Neutrality is something we need right now, but I think it is a band aid and do not support it long term.  I do not like the government regulating something like that, because I think the market should and would optimally work that out.

That being said, ISPs currently are not operating in a free market, and consumers do not have many choices which allow for healthy competition.  If that were truly the case, I would absolutely oppose Net Neutrality, but it isn't.","I'm not against net neutrality, but I don't think it's as big of a deal as many people are making it out to be. I'm going to be explaining some possible reasons repealing net neutrality might be a good thing, but before I explain these reasons, I should point out that these are theories and a devil's advocate side to the issue. The chances of these changes being used for good is low, but it is definitely there.

Firstly, if net neutrality does go bust, one of the changes that will most likely happen is complimentary access to certain services. There already is a little bit of that now with certain streaming services coming with your purchase of a certain isp, but it's hard to do that now with current laws. Repealing net neutrality will make it easier. This could help increase competition if smaller isp's are able to give certain services with their internet service.

Secondly, if the internet turns into something like the viral picture of Portugals internet, isp's will likely charge less for basic internet without the extras to attract more customers; kinda like how car manufacturer's advertise their vehicles price without options. For most people, this isn't really important, but for people like myself who aren't using the internet for much more than social media, it could be a good thing.

Thirdly, traffic controlling could work out well depending on whether isp's use it to allow more data and speed towards websites with higher demand or not. For places like YouTube or Reddit that get a lot of traffic, internet speeds could be maintained or even increased at the expense of less crowded websites. Now this can be good for the average consumer, but not for startup or local businesses.

Fourthly, certain states (particularly ones that are highly liberal) are likely to input their own laws towards net neutrality. The FCC has no power to preempt what states can and cannot put in as laws for regulating networks, no matter how much Comcast and Verizon want them to. Isp's say that this will be disasterous for their businesses if they have to provide different internet service to people in different states due to cost and changes in their infrastructure, but that's what they need to get rid of their monopoly and for local isp's to strive.

Fifthly (this is more of a joke reason), we could spend more time outside. Probably a good thing.

Also I'd like to point out that the protests and calls to Representatives won't do much since people who can't use money to their advantage (aka lobbying) have almost no voice in the decisions being made in government. Taking a basic political science class confirmed it for me. However that doesn't mean you shouldn't voice your opinion at all, because it has worked in the past.","I can see an argument that dismantling net neutrality could be a useful way of reducing the monopoly power of the big tech companies like Google and Facebook. If people have to pay extra to access those I imagine many would just opt out and try alternatives.","Towns and cities and states should then have special road use tax for ISP maintenance vehicles and maybe even tax their buildings and properties at a special higher rate. ","I don't oppose getting rid of net neutrality in theory but I will remain a supporter of net neutrality as long as ISP providers exist as monopolies. If there were many ISPs to choose from they would have to offer the best value service possible to remain in business. Unfortunately they already have the ability to screw over their customers. For example, I can get Comcast or I can get fucked. It's not a free market if customers do not have a choice.","Some remarks on Net Neutrality, in the form of a list of questions:

Also, it's wrong. The government should not be telling people what to do with their own property.

Lastly, it's dangerous. The government should not be regulating or controlling speech on the internet.","I'm in favor of net neutrality, but only because the system in place for delivering internet into your home is incredibly corrupt. There is no competition in the home internet market because these companies have been granted local monopolies. Local ordinances literally make competition impossible in most places and so you're only left with really one choice for cable or internet. I would like to see these government enforced monopolies dissolved and the market opened up to more competition. When that happens I will be against net neutrality for some of the reasons /u/laminar_flo listed. 

I also don't believe that net neutrality should apply to wireless carriers, only wired carriers. There actually is competition in the wireless internet sphere, even if its limited to a few companies (Verison, ATT, TMobile, Sprint). TMobile has done a lot to promote competition and pro-consumer policies, and the market has been rewarding them for it, but not all of it would fall under a 'net neutrality' umbrella. ","Honestly the whole thing seems like a Faustian bargain where we're being offered two bad options by the government/corporate elites

I agree in principle. The issue that I see is that there isn't a free market in home internet. The city or town you live in decides what internet you are allowed to have before you even move in.

What is the problem with that? If the costs get too high, then the consumer can pay more. It happens with every utility, product and service. It can happen with ISPs. If a customer pays for 20mbps, it's their right under contract to use that. If the network cannot handle it, increase the cost.

1. Why isn't it fair for TWC, VZ etc to cover increasing costs of bandwidth and maintenance as that is their business? Wouldn't these costs just get passed onto the consumer? From what I understand bandwidth isn't that expensive (just heard without any real research so enlighten me if there are competing theories about that, it is the roll out of fiber and infrastructure that's a killer).

2. Would it really lower costs for consumers? Is it more likely that we could pay less money, but have way less value? For example: This is TWC's check email and facebook plan for 15 a month. But for 5 more bucks you can stream video too. They'll make bank getting that 15 a month from everyone and you know the cost of adding streaming is way less than 5 bucks for TWC. Or more likely because we are all so used to paying 35-50 a month for internet that they'll just start it around as a base package and add up as we want more use.

3. How would it help create faster speeds? 
4. What do you mean about premium browsing?

You seem to articulated your reasons well, hope to have a conversation. ","Consumers still have to pay for what they use, it just shouldn’t be based on how they use it.

> The ISPs are handcuffed in their ability to recoup broadband infrastructure costs from Netflix

Except, you know, charging the people who use the service. If you want to sell low data rate plans, that's your prerogative. If you want to sell bandwidth sufficient to watch Netflix, that's your prerogative. But you can't complain when people use that bandwidth.

 That's like renting a car for a month and 2000 miles, then complaining when they bring it back with 1999 miles on it. It's within your right to engage in the terms of your business, as long as it doesn't discriminate against specific traffic. 

> the biggest consumers of internet bandwidth will be the ones who actually pay the most money.

Netflix pays for a connection to the network. They have their own ISP. The consumer has their own ISP. Netflix is consuming bandwidth according to their agreement with their ISP. The consumer is consuming bandwidth according to their agreement with the ISP. Having someone step in the middle and claim a piece of their business just because they have lobbied for the legal right to discriminate against data is *literal highway robbery*. 

> ISPs are not allowed to prioritize the HBO or ESPN traffic during peak demand periods

This is absolute bullshit. **Please retract this statement formally**. It is absolutely false. Netflix in particular operates a number of CDNs which are provided to ISPs to reduce the bandwidth between ISPs, to better serve the link between the ISP and the consumer. That is a legal method to address backend congestion.","What makes you think the ISPs will be nice about it and give you extra shit for free?",">I don't want the government micro-managing the internet, which is exactly what will happen when the FCC starts trying to define fairness.

But that's not what net neutrality is about. In fact, it's specifically about preventing *any* micromanagement of the internet. The core tenant of NN is ""Transmit every byte of data equally"". Customers pay for a certain transmission rate and a certain amount/bandwidth of data, and they should get *whatever* they ask for, from any source they want, equally. 

>Netflix represents 1/3 of all American internet traffic during primetime. The ISPs are handcuffed in their ability to recoup broadband infrastructure costs from Netflix. People are worried about ISPs cutting off users from smaller content providers, but ending net neutrality will mean the biggest consumers of internet bandwidth will be the ones who actually pay the most money.

NN isn't about preventing high consumers from paying higher rates. That's already the reality. If I pay for 20Mbit/second speeds and unlimited data, then that's the functional equivalent of allowing me to constantly download *anything I want* at that speed 24/7. If your infrastructure can't support that, then don't sell it to me. 

What NN is actually about is you deciding that Netflix traffic is ""bad"" but Comcast traffic is ""good"" and charging me MORE to use Netflix. Every byte of data has the same impact on your network, regardless of whether it's Netflix traffic or Comcast traffic, so there's no justification at all for you to charge me to download bytes from Netflix but not charge me to download bytes from Comcast. 

NN does not prevent an ISP from charging more money to its customers if they use more data. It prevents them from charging more money for using *specific* data. 


","Netflix sending data over the Internet shouldn’t be a problem. If they are using 1/3 of the bandwidth, they should fairly be paying the same price as anyone who uses that much.

I really don't understand this statement. It seems horrifyingly naive and misinformed. Would neutrality not be beneficial in this regard? What makes you think your streaming experience would not decline, let alone increase? You said yourself netflix accounts for 1/3 of traffic - specifically on an ongoing consistent basis compared to peak events which may have a higher amount but for a significantly shorter time frame - so would it not make sense that they would be paying more overall to the ISPs to have the better service? It seems to me like this has just as much chance of negatively affecting events rather than constant streaming services like netflix or youtube. ""Sorry, netflix has given us more money on a regular basis so we're prioritising their traffic. You don't need fast speeds to watch a superb owl hoot about right? 480p should be fine for that!

It also works the other way around - ""Why should my (insert applicable) [downloads|online game|netflix|porn|surveillance system|spotify|company's client facing web-app|etc.] be throttled because the new game of thrones just came out?""

Your points are good, but it seems to me that the system is set up to make the big players money, not to benefit the customers.

This feels so backwards to me.  The whole point of NN is to NOT micro-manage.  The definition of fairness within NN is ""hands off"".  ","The concept of Net Neutrality at its purest means that no one can micro-manage the Internet. Not the government, not the ISPs.

2. We're already at monopoly of ISPs. No, 5G towers won't do anything and there's no reason to expect that to change it at all.

3. The ISPs can raise prices if they feel ""infrastructure"" ( oh please ) is costing too much for them. Then someone can come along and say ""Hey. We'll give you Netflix without complaining about maintenance."" That also doesn't explain why ""infrastructure"" doesn't seem to be an issue for Comcast whenever Google Fiber gets set up.

","1. I worded this poorly. I meant that it does not make sense for costs to rise for the consumer or for the ISP for a service such as Netflix to *storm* their bandwidth during primetime, Netflix honestly should have to pay more for traffic to their systems.

2. Costs could drop for consumers could, ***could*** be a byproduct of charging the companies in question for their premium traffic. E: Again, such as Netflix covering their share of ISPs bandwidth during primetime (I believe it is at something like 1/3 of traffic nowadays) could mean that these costs do **not** have to be passed to consumers. Another reason for this will be expanded on below.

3. Faster speeds could be achieved by this, unfortunately, only in the worst case scenario (is what I think). Reason for this being, if we DO end up paying premiums for ""lanes"" of traffic, then these increased profits could lead to restructuring of cable lines for fiber connections. Also expanded below.

4. Premium browsing, such as a monthly costs for a social media ""lane"" was never a guaranteed thing to occur by these companies, yet it is the main, and one of the ONLY largely-known arguments for being pro-net neutrality.

5. Side-note, is a premium for lanes of traffic ***really a bad thing?*** Take a scenario in which the base cost for internet was ~$30 a month at ~10mbps. Say you're a gamer, and you want to pay an extra $10-20 a month for the gaming ""lane"", now getting ~50-100mbps for gaming related traffic at $50 monthly instead of paying $100 a month for just flat increased speed and bandwidth. Then, just use the 10mbps base speed for stuff you don't do that often like social media or streaming.

That's not the ISPs prioritizing traffic. That's Netflix circumventing the lack of prioritization by building the back end of their own private ISP. They're one of the only companies in the world with the traffic necessary to justify that sort of investment and the capital to actually do it.

Without net neutrality, the ISPs and content providers would be able to work together and provide products that are beneficial to the consumer. You can see an example of this in the mobile broadband space, which has never been subjected to net neutrality. T-Mobile is able exclude certain streaming video sites from their data caps to entice people to use their service. Comcast has started a 3rd-party cell carrier by leasing bandwidth on the Verizon network, and they're able to offer similar data cap exceptions for their own licensed video content. NN supporters probably view this as a bad thing, but I see it as a positive compared to the alternative, where everything is uniformly subject to the same data caps and there's nothing for the providers to compete on except for price.","There wasn't a substantial free market growth.

Not really. The local monopolies exist through local laws that prohibit competition, which is the opposite of a free market. These monopolies also exist because wired and fiber-optic infrastructure is incredibly expensive to build and maintain, so it is advantageous for the cable companies to have their own little fiefdoms where they can control as much market share as possible.

I've been saying it all over this thread, but I think 5G wireless internet is really going to be the mechanism that turns the entire ISP economy on its head. If one of the wireless carriers builds out 5G service in an area, they (or any company who leases access to their network) can immediately offer high speed internet to every single home within the coverage radius, and they don't have to run cables to a single home. It would also be much more feasible for municipalities to start their own ISPs, as they'd only have to build some 5G towers instead of running fiber through every neighborhood in town. Mark my words, 5G will be to cable ISPs what ride sharing was to the taxi companies.","5G will change everything, and there is every reason to expect it.  It will give wireless carriers the ability to handle the same volume of data that wired ISPs can now, but without having to pay for the 'final mile' of cable.

Anti-competitive behavior would be the telecoms locking out content they don't own, which would still violate anti-trust laws even without net neutrality.

>Now you're saying that telecoms giving competitive advantages to their own content is totally ok?

Yes. I fail to see how it's any different from other industries where companies can gain an advantage by becoming vertically integrated. If Ford Motors merged with an aluminum manufacturer because it allowed them to sell aluminum vehicles much cheaper than anyone else, it would not be anti-competitive unless they controlled the entire aluminum industry and refused to sell to their competitors.

That's not what net neutrality means at all. All net neutrality means is that everyone involved has to charge based on the amount of data, not the type of data. It hurts me to even type out ""the type of data"" because there are not different types of data. A byte of data is just a byte of data. If it needs to go through an intermediary, the intermediary should get a cut of the revenue for delivering that byte of data. They can work out a deal to make that happen without charging me more to stream a gig of Netflix than they charge me to download a gig of Microsoft Word files.

>Those intermediaries also have to build infrastructure to accommodate that traffic even though they're not getting paid at either end.

This isn't true. The idea that big content providers don't have to pay for their bandwidth is a myth. They pay big money for their bandwidth. It's up to the network providers to charge the right amount of money to create the peer to peer connections so the internet works. If Comcast has to spend money to bring up a new peer with a backhauler like Level 3 or Cogent, then they need to raise prices with their end users. If a backhauler needs to put in new gear to peer with someone else, then they charge money to those ISPs that need their infrastructure. Not all networks are created equally either. Just do some traceroutes to different end points across the country. There will be some terrible paths with way too many hops to certain areas. 

What Netflix offered Comcast was actually to both of their advantage, and Comcast really shouldn't have demanded payment. Comcast would be paying for the bandwidth over the open internet to get to Netflix servers anyway, but Netflix offered them a direct path to their servers. The cost to turn up a direct peer (which is pretty cheap) is often eaten as both parties know they are saving money on the bandwidth costs. It's beneficial to both. Comcast saves money on bandwidth for the low cost of doing a few directs while both parties are probably already in the same collocation facilities. It's better service for Comcast customers, and consumers don't blame Netflix if their shows don't load fast enough. Everyone wins. If a cost/benefit analysis shows the cost of turning up a direct is more than the bandwidth savings, then by all means don't do it, or ask the content provider to pay, but I don't see how you wouldn't save money.","> The host has to pay for their upload bandwidth, and you have to pay for your download bandwidth, but the data might pass through several intermediaries that you're not paying at all.

The ISPs don't own that content. They take your bits and get then from point A to point B. That is all. They obviously don't like this arrangement, because they can't nickel and dime people. 

Not only that but the ISPs DO own some content. Each of them has a media arm - for Comcast for example it's NBCUniversal.they want to be able to vertically integrate - that is, to use their leverage as an ISP to get an advantage in their other markets. That means that Netflix has less negotiating power as a distributor, and could even pay random to the ISPs just as a normal course of business. 

This wouldn't be so bad, except the ISPs have a local Monopoly. So if ATT sent me a letter tomorrow saying they are restricting access to certain services, ports, IP addresses, whatever. I could be like, well fuck that, I'm out, cancel my service. But then who do I go to?

Nobody. ATT is my only choice for broadband. Wow internet just showed up in the last month but I would need to pay to hook up the house. And then there is no guarantee that they wouldn't do the same thing in a month. 

And then there's accountability. Did you know that if you have a phone with a data subscription, they are not allowed to stop you from installing a tethering app? For a layperson that sounds like not a big deal. But if you know the internet tech, it is literally built for routing. It is zero cost to bounce that signal from your laptop to your phone and then out. They wanted to discriminate against what device you used the internet you paid for with. 

And then it was made illegal to block. They can't stop you from installing a tethering app. But you know what they can do? Since cellphones are not protected by Net Neutrality, they can literally redirect every single search you do for the app to their sales page for tethering plans. And they did. I was in the middle of nowhere and needed to tether my laptop and despite what I was trying to do being protected by law, they we're censoring my access to the information required to do it.

This is the world we are going toward. ","This is kind of a terrible analogy as well because in this case the ISP isn't (or shouldn't be) the restaurant taking orders. 

Since we're sticking with restaurant analogies, let's try this one... 

You run an third party food delivery service. Your business model is this: You charge each customer a monthly subscription fee, and you deliver food to them. You tier your plans like this: 5 meals worth of food for $10/m, 20 meals worth of food for $20/m and unlimited meals worth of food for $50/m. Your operating budget assumes that you'll need to deliver every single meal for the tiers 10 and 20 meal tiers, and you assume people ordering the unlimited tier will probably use it 30 times per month. 

Fortunately for you, almost nobody bought the unlimited plan, and most people bought the 20 meal plan. They also rarely used more than 10 meals per month. And since they're paying the restaurant themselves and you're just doing the deliveries, it's great. Especially when customers use *less* than the number of meals they paid for in a month, and the fact that they mostly only order dinner. 

So, for a couple years, your business operates great. The average amount of food you need to deliver is only like 8 meals per person per month because hardly anyone uses their full allotment, and because nobody can even afford to order enough food to take advantage of their ""unlimited"" plan. 

Because of this, you decide that even though you're adding lots of new subscribers, you really don't need to hire more delivery drivers. Sure, the ones you have are getting a little over worked, but it's fine, you're still making all your deliveries. Barely. 

Then a new restaurant in town, All The Eats, opens up... they've got a crazy new model, too... they've decided ""Hey, we're going to charge a flat subscription rate instead of a per-meal rate. Pay us $100/m and you can order as much takeout food as you want!"" 

Well, fuck. Now all of your customers who used to only use half of their ""bandwidth"" of meal deliveries suddenly want to use their entire number of meals. Now all of your 10 meal/month customers are using all 10. Your 20 meal/month customers are using all 20. And your unlimited customers are using 30+/month! 

Holy crap! Now you need to hire some new delivery drivers... how will you ever pay for those new delivery drivers to handle all the new deliveries you have?! Obviously you can't dip into the insane profits you've already been making due to the fact that you've been over-charging people for *years*... 

Instead, you decide that, even though you promised your customers that they could get X number of meals per month for a flat rate, you're actually going to charge a surplus to order from the unlimited place. Now customers have to pay their monthly fee to the unlimited restaurant, their monthly fee to you (the delivery service) AND a per-delivery fee just to get food from that one place?

Or, your buddies decide that THEY want to open one of these cool new unlimited restaurants that everyone loves. But All the Eats has a lot of market share... your friend's new place, Lots-a-Meals, is struggling... so he says to you, ""Hey, you're charging people $2/delivery to get food from All the Eats, right? Tell you what, let your customers order from me for free and I'll kick you $1/deliver!"" 

So now you, as the delivery company, are deciding which business gets to succeed and which one gets to fail based on which one you like better/make a deal with/charge more money to. 

That's what net neutrality stops. The delivery company's job is to DELIVER. Not to decide what content gets delivered. 

If a particular content provider is taking ""too much bandwidth"", well, that's kind of your fault for offering customers a service which you can't provide. 
","Oh so terrible for the restaurant, except they have paid the government off in order to be the only restaurant in town. Lots of people want to open new restaurants and compete, but they can't. 

I've always thought that is the problem with getting rid of Net Neutrality. If the ISPs want to charge for different access to content providers, I say fine, as long as the market is truly free enough to get real competition. Most of America has one broadband provider and AT&T (or similar) DSL available to them, and it's because of big ISP lobbyists that keep competition at bay. If ISPs are a monopoly then internet needs to be treated like a utility.

Not because the USPS wants their competing service to have an advantage.

They are doing that to hide the fact that they want to be able to be the gatekeepers of what you see and do on the internet. Full stop.

Unless you have a load balancing router that will roughly evenly divide the available resources between whatever you have going on. Well ISPs aren't really any different. Thousands of customers all gaming, streaming, downloading can push utilization up unevenly between customers. As result Joe can't download his files (fill his glass) anywhere close to the advertised speeds he's paying for - so to mitigate this issue ISPs also perform load balancing - aka Throttling. I'm not defending Ajit or the repeal of Title II regs but I think it's totally fair to throttle data hogs so ISPs can provide more reliable, more consistent service, something more closely resembling what they had originally advertised to consumers.

Except that is exactly the problem. Comcast has 40% of the cable internet marketshare.

What happens is this: NFLX pushes movies to LVLT’s CDN and then the CDN blasts all this data onto, say, CMCSA’s network so it can get to your house. The volume that NFLX is pushing data is insane so it bogs down all of CMCSA’s network, not just the connection point, so all of their network slows down and all their customers get pissed bc Stranger Things is choppy.

>So this is what happens: LVLT has to upgrade the connection point. Let’s say this costs $100. They charge NFLX for this. But CMCSA has to upgrade their side of the connection point for $100, and for that they charge.....nobody - they pay it. Also, they have to upgrade their internal network to cover all this new traffic that NFLX is causing. This costs $250 and CMCSA has to pay that too. So CMCSA says “this is bullshit. NFLX is causing us to incur $350 total costs to our network and they aren’t paying us a thing and NN prevents us from directly charging NFLX and NN stops us from disconnecting from LVLT to force them to pay more.”

>Now multiply this relationship by all ISPs. Using all made up numbers here: You can make an economic argument that NFLX is causing a ‘burden’ of $3000 to all ISPs but is only paying $500 and is ‘free riding’ to the tune of $2500 off the ‘sharing’ agreements that are kept in place by NN.

>There is a famous hedge fund/short seller named Jim chanos that was short NFLX and his whole thesis was that NFLX cannot economically exist without this free riding arrangement. He’s 1000% correct. ATT went to the FCC under the obama administration and tried to disconnect from LVLT to force NFLX to pay their fair share of the costs. The FCC said “No Dice - NN means you share traffic and NFLX is taking advantage but those are the breaks. ATT, you go pound sand.” Chanos’ short position exploded and the rest is wall st history. HOWEVER, if NN goes away and NFLX has to pay a ‘fair carriage’ rate, the stock will get fucking blasted (and this is before we talk about all the cash they are burning on media).","If you feel that way, why aren't you asking the federal government to bust up these local monopolies using antitrust laws?

Customers will stop buying their service and theyll lose money. They’re not stupid. If people can’t stream Netflix on their service then they’ll cancel. You’re acting like these companies are just gonna go out of business to spite us. That’s not gonna happen ","That's because for power, there are consumables involved. Using more kWh burns more coal (or whatever.)

Internet data is not consumable. Using more data does not mean there's less out there somewhere.

Therefore, the more comparable analogy is the *bandwidth* available. There's only so much open in any given pipeline at any given time, so using more bandwidth *does* reduce what's left.

So in order for the ISPs to charge for internet access the same way that power companies do, they should charge by the bandwidth you use which...

Oh, wait, they do. You buy a package with a certain download/upload speed. You pay for the amount of consumable you use. Data caps on plans are just a scuzzy way of grabbing more money.","Not quite true. Many, if not all, ISPs will give you a data limit per month.

","The (ISP) monopolies don't need to be broken up, the government just needs to give permission to new companies to access the infrastructure that is already in place: poles and conduit. Utility poles and conduits are managed by local governments who can force the true monopolies (utility companies) to lease access to their infrastructure. 

Back in the day the electric companies ask for permission from the cities to obtain easements on people's land (or government streets) to put in poles and conduit to get people power. The phone companies also wanted to use the poles and since this was in the best interest of the people, and there was no competition, the power companies said sure and got some extra money. Then cable TV said, hey! we can get better TV to people, so they paid a lease and got access. Then the phone companies could start offering DSL. Great, no big deal. But then the cable companies figured out they could offer even better internet. Well, the phone companies didn't like this, but the coax was already in place, and the lease was secured, so they had to live with it. But now you have two internet providers using the same poles, and they have a lot of lobbying power to keep any new player out of the game. Competition springs up here and there. It's not impossible, but they still spend millions of dollars to keep competition off those poles.

I help run an ISP for a commercial park. We buy fiber from AT&T and have to use wireless to get from building to building because the cost of leasing the conduit from AT&T makes it cost prohibited to operate. This commercial park has had nothing but shit AT&T DSL for a decade since it was built. We have been selling asymmetrical high bandwidth internet for a year now, and what do I see down the street yesterday? An AT&T truck laying fiber from building to building so they can offer a better product that can compete with us. Competition makes products better. The only reason we could even get the fiber from AT&T to begin with was because of previous reselling agreements with AT&T.

The whole point of this is: if the government is granting easements to companies to get services to the consumer, then the government is truly responsible for who has access to that infrastructure and they need to make it available for new competition, not squeeze out competition to bankroll the politician's re-election campaigns. I would support any legislation, or politician that advocated for this.","Yep. The existing infrastructure can only accommodate so many packets concurrently which, when reaching it's limitations, means customers suffer.

To maximize allocative efficiency, the market should minimize the number of firms so that this cost is spread over as many consumers as possible.","The providers wouldn't  like it if people are trying to take away their monopoly so they would do everything they could to stop it, I mean they could buy the officials out to stop them","> Even with NN supposedly being the law of the land for two years now there is tremendous disparity among what’s available to people and the reality of what we get.

Did you not understand a single point of what I've been explaining? They're gonna be throttling speeds of EVERY website. News, YouTube, Bing/Google, Porn, that website little Timmy owns from his basement, everything. You name it, it's getting slowed. 


I do not understand how you can claim to be against something so important when you are clueless about it. ","If they really wanted to be ""fair"", they would just meter bandwidth the way every other utility is metered.  That way if I leave town for a week, I'm not paying for internet because I'm not using it.  Likewise, if I'm streaming on five devices simultaneously, I'll pay more, because I'm a bigger burden on the system.  If I have a big ass 8k screen, I'll pay more to get the resolution to match.

     This is detrimental. Net neutrality means that all traffic is regarded as equal and that's how it should be.  My ISP saying they want to throttle my netflix because it is what I use the most is wrong on so many levels.
    I pay for a monthly service that in reality i will never reach. To give my ISP the power to throttle what I do is giving my ISP power over a service they do not provide. I pay a monthly fee to netflix and I pay my ISP for connection to the internet and that is all. I pay for 10mps but in reality only get 1 or 2. If I have multiple netflix, Hulu or other streaming services going and my 1 or 2 mps bandwidth cannot handle it I get load times. Its not like they are opening a bigger pipe for my data.

>I mean they could buy the officials out to stop them

OK, so you're worried about corrupt government officials using their power to control the internet, and your solution is to give the government more power to control the internet.","
1. The general idea of Net Neutrality is to treat all internet traffic ""equally."" This means every packet, no matter where is comes from on the internet, is supposed to be given the exact same priority as every other packet being sent across the network - by law. Nowadays ISPs have systems in place to give priority to websites which use large amounts of bandwidth like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services. They do this to keep traffic flowing at a high speed for services that need it, and if they didn't their customers would be bombarded by constant buffering and connection problems when trying to watch any kind of streaming video (sites like YouTube would be unbearable to use). Net Neutrality would kill this practice, as it forces all traffic to be treated equally and ISPs would no longer be able to have these ""high speed lanes"" where they give priority to high bandwidth applications - and it's not even for things like video, ISPs typically have to gear up for games like World of Warcraft when it was in it's hayday because their launches would put such a strain on the network. Again, Net Neutrality would force the ISPs to not be able to do this.

2. Because laying the foundation and building the infrastructure for these types of services is expensive, In the last several years ISPs and content providers have reached deals where they partially split the cost. The ISPs claim that the costs for adding to their infrastructure is expensive as they need to do construction projects like dig up roads, lay wiring down, and purchase the physical computer hardware to be able to support the additions to their network. Indeed, expanding your network to support customer demand costs millions of dollars and as more and more content providers offer more streaming services and other high bandwidth applications the ISPs need to keep expanding and growing to keep their customers happy. One of the biggest fights in Net Neutrality is all about money. The content providers don't want to help foot the bill for these costs, and if the ""high speed lanes"" mentioned above no longer become an option for ISPs they will be forced to lay more infrastructure because they are no longer allowed to prioritize traffic in an efficient manner. This means higher cable bills for all customers to pay for these additions unless they keep striking deals with content providers like Netflix, so essentially even if you don't use Netflix you'd be subsidizing someone else's Netflix bill. If they continue to strike deals then the Netflix customers will see increases in their subscription costs (which is more fair as they are the reason for the increased demand on the network anyway). Content providers love the idea of Net Neutrality because the ISPs can no longer claim that streaming video or other applications are the reason for network congestion as all packets are to be treated equally. This takes them completely off the hook for aiding in new infrastructure costs that the ISPs will need to spend to keep their customers happy. Again, it's a giant battle over who pays for what. 

3. In terms of pure economic philosophy these rules would essentially be telling companies how they need to operate - the ISPs that is - and how they are allowed to sell or produce their product. In most cases this is government overreach, and while there is an argument to be made for penalizing ISPs for throttling traffic or flat out banning services to customers it has very rarely happened and when it has there have been lots of public outcry and sometimes fines levied, which is how the system is supposed to work. If you believe that unfettered capitalism is one of the main catalysts for innovation then Net Neutrality will put a chokehold on this as ISPs will now be forced to move at the speed of government rather than designing their own networks to keep traffic flowing in the most efficient manner possible and doing so to try and keep the maximum amount of customers happy.
","I... What?

I'm all for net neutrality - I was defending the reasoning to the post above.","> OK, so you're worried about corrupt government officials using their power to control the internet, and your solution is to give the government more power to control the internet.

Game. Set. Match. ","The problem isnt that they're giving high speed lanes to services with big packets, but that the ISPs seek to be able to sell those fast lanes. When we want net neutrality, we don't want to change the internet, we want to keep it like it is. The rules prohibit Internet providers from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization—""fast lanes"" for sites that pay, and slow lanes for everyone else. Without Net Neutrality they can not only make certain websites load faster, but they can also slow the rest as they deem fit with no limits other than the ""free"" market.

We don't want to radically change the internet with government regulation, we just want to keep things as they are. Are you unsatisfied with your lack of widespread slowlanes and fastlanes?

>  Net Neutrality will put a chokehold on this as ISPs will now be forced to move at the speed of government rather than designing their own networks to keep traffic flowing in the most efficient manner possible and doing so to try and keep the maximum amount of customers happy.

It's not a product, it's a service. That's why so many people also want this to be classified as a Utility. Wouldn't you want the same satisfaction and regulation that is imposed on your electricity supply and water supply to be imposed on your internet?
Nobody is forcing AT&T or Comcast to lower their rates and be nonshit companies.
","Yeah I wasn’t arguing against your post just providing additional context with my experiences with me isp","We aren’t going to reach middle ground.

Why would you trust the corporation to get it right when it's their job to screw over as many customers as possible in the biggest margins available? 

What we want is to keep the internet like it is today, not to make government control it.
