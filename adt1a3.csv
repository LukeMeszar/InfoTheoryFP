The vast majority of internet traffic is due to streaming sites, who rely on cheap data rates for their business model. Net Neutrality means Comcast (for example) CAN'T charge YouTube a premium for using, say, 50% of its total bandwidth. It was ALWAYS about MONEY, not censorship - if Google/CondeNast/Facebook/Twitter/Netflix/etc. actually cared about censorship they wouldn't fucking do it THEMSELVES. Make no mistake about it, the internet is nowhere near as free or open as it was in the early 2000s, and it's not your ISP's fault either.

I'm looking at you Google, Youtube, twitter.... you're AMERICAN companies. Start acting like it, and stop censoring views just because Saudi Arabia or China told you to and you thought it'd give you more customers.

Meanwhile what really happened is 5G technology and internet speeds increasing by 1/3 from last year. Competition for ISP has only continue to increase because of capitalism and non-regulation reducing the price while increasing speeds. What is also beautiful thing is now that communities or cities can build their own ISP and be in direct competition with companies like Xfinity/Comcast, Centrelink and AT&T.

They've all started to work together so for example if Google can't restrict your ability to pop up on the search engine (they will try to push you deeper into the results of a search, think 6th or 7th page), the Domains will just remove you all together, or the money transactors will strip away your ability to make money.

the internet must be tamed","NN was fundamentally an economic argument between big ISPs (think Comcast) and big content providers (think Neflix).

(There is probably no good solution to that conflict.)

Historically, large networks did not pay for transit. They peered with each other. If two huge ISPs connect via a fiber optic line, which one is the customer and which is the provider? The answer is: they are both peers, and don't charge each other.

The big content providers tell the big ISPs: ""I'm a big network. I want to peer with you."" And they did. The problem is ISPs spend a lot of money upgrading their routers and links to carry the huge traffic from Netflix etc. Then Netflix monetizes that traffic, but the ISP generally can't. This leads to envy and discontent.

So Comcast wants to treat Netflix more like a customer and less like a peer. Charge them for transit. And this is very scary to Netflix, not just because it impacts their bottom line. If you want to send a packet to a Comcast customer your only choice is to transit the Comcast network. That means Comcast has a total monopoly over that route. That means over time Comcast can keep raising the ""peering fees"" until they suck almost all the profit out of Neflix. 

That's a situation tech leaders understand instinctively - they all want to be the guy raising the fees on a rich and helpless customer.

There is something very confusing at the heart of this problem. When two ISPs peer, they increase their costs, but they increase their value, since the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes. (Metcalf's law.)

But when an ISP peers with a content provider, does Metcalf's law still apply? Is Netflix just one node or one node per movie?





","It was so dumb.

To be fair, there are real threats. Traffic shaping by ISPs is the biggest technical threat.

But people were so loud about fighting for the idea of NN that they totally forgot they were defending a regulation, with real words in it, that they had never read. If they were to read those words they would realize that what they were fighting for wasn't NN the idea, but shelter for the big online tech companies from anticompetitive behavior.","I would comment, but i died when net neutrality was repealed","Sad and pathetic how easily gullible leftists and LIVs were used as pawns to try and push muh net neutrality. The amount of blatant astroturfing and collusion from these paid off shills that came out of nowhere and then suddenly stopped was amazing.

Meanwhile, Internet speeds and access continues to rapidly increase, while the true neutrality of the Internet continues to rapidly decrease because of leftist/SJW-operated monopolies deplatforming and censoring whatever and wherever possible.","It was always about stifiling and killing competition for a select few companies that had made the """"""correct"""""" political donations. It became a monopolized trust, where 2-3 companies could charge anything and dictate information, speed, access, etc.

Utopia, comrades. ","Why the fuck T_D keeps sucking Silicon Vally’s dick on this is beyond me, but for fucks sake *giving ISPs more control over our data is a shitty idea and you guys should be furious about it.*

After the FCC repeal the states passed their own net neutrality laws, specifically in order to circumvent the FCC decision.

It being struck down is going to have long standing consequences. In some time, soon you'll be paying for individual websites and ISPs will be free to block websites they don't ""agree"" with. They aren't going to do it all at once, they couldn't get away with it. 

But instead they're going to chip away, little by little, until we're being nickled and dimed for everything and ""wrong think"" is dictated by ISPs and you'll only have yourselves to blame for thinking you're ""so much smarter than the left"" when really it's both of you getting fucked over, but the right getting fucked even harder by this because ISPs are typically leftist companies.","Help the less enlightened out for a moment.

The Party had been in control for years, with CNN and the rest of the news blog-sphere in place. But around 2014 they started to notice they were losing control. So Obama comes up with the plan to start up net neutering that was going to be ran by the The Party. Of course they only have two-ish years left, and he doesn't get it into law until 2015. 

The goal was to get Hilary to win, so it could be made into a more solid law, especially with the plan to set up whoever was on the republican side with ""Russian Collusion"" charges. Likely this could have been any major internet crisis while obama was in charge, but its possible that they couldn't figure out a way to put it into place before the election. 

So as the election approaches, they develop that last part of the plan, get a few facebook things out there to be fake news, then reveal that the republican totally colluded with russia (even if they have to hide or make it up.) just like the three badguys in the Count of Monte Cristo trying to make it seem like the protagonist is colluding with Napoleon. 

Now the goverment needs to take more control of the internet! Can't have traitors (which they would have tried the republican as fast as they could have)  attempting to undermine the election. they start banning the crap out of everything they could.

There has always been something fuckey about it, and then the site had tons of posts stickied to even the smallest subreddits about Net Neutrality, all from the same “awareness” organization.","WTF!?!   Social media already has too much power over our data, so it doesn’t matter if the ISPs have too much now!?!  How does that make sense?","Because NN did nothing to curb censorship as it's only goal was to turn private ISP's into government entities to ""limit their profits"" but as some people quickly noticed things like throttling and slow downs actually increased.

Blew his mind when I asked how could a private website such as Google and Twitter ban Alex Jones? Are they small private companies who have no influence in our society? What makes an ISP public but YouTube private? Can't have your cake and eat it too. Google and Twitter have already done what they're bitching about, limiting access to content and throttle individual accounts from being accessable to the public.

They're trying to treat ISPs as public companies adhering to federal regulations and trying to treat internet companies as private entities free from oversight. Some monopolistic companies act like ISP today. They provide so much access to information, they're the cornerstone of the internet just as much as ISPs are.

Most people are real satisfied as long they get those basics and could care less about the government destroying everything else.","> It was the most obvious and disgusting shilling campaign

It's the top post for almost every single subreddit, even ones that have nothing to do with the internet or technology. When I see net neutrality in my car subreddit getting 5 times more upvotes than the next highest topic of all time it makes me wonder who is pushing this shit so hard.
","That one time when every single subreddit has a post about Net Neutrality that got tens of thousands of upvotes even on subreddits that only had a few hundred users","When subs with top posts that barely had 1k votes had neutrality posts with 15k, that made me a little suspicious.","This will be a wall of text, sorry.  Just woke up and can't consolidate my points.

So Net Neutrality was the concept that all network traffic should be given equal priority and and should be billed the same rate, regardless of if said traffic congests the network, or costs the ISP's a lot of money. Hence, neutrality.  The traffic would be looked upon neutrally, with no judgement made upon it.

At first glance this might seem like a good idea.  The problem is, all traffic isn't equal, so it shouldn't be treated equal.  Some websites/services congest the network and cause traffic issues for websites/services that use very little data.  An example would be financial data which keeps the economy going and uses very little data every second would be caught up in network congestion from millions of people streaming HD video which uses a ton of data every second.  Being neutral to internet traffic is the same as ignoring context of a quote.  

Continuing on, the best analogy I thought of was that of shipping different size and weight packages at different speeds (since the internet works by delivering packets of info back and forth).  If there was a net neutrality for shipping packages (a shipping neutrality of sorts), UPS/Fedex would have to ship all packages for the same price no matter what the cost was to them.  An envelope full of legal documents would cost as much to ship as a refrigerator despite the refrigerator taking more manpower, more gas, and and an overall higher burden to move around.  This obviously doesn't happen in real life because it doesn't make sense.  Shipping companies make you pay more if you want things to arrive faster or if it costs them more to move it.

Continuing with this shipping analogy, Amazon wasn't be able to promise it's millions of customers next day shipping on an item and expect UPS/fedex to make it happen without compensating them for making it happen.  Making next day shipping work required shipping companies to vastly upgrade their infrastructure to keep up with their other responsibilities and you can bet they bill or have billed a high user like Amazon for the cost.

The same holds true for ISP's.  Netflix, Youtube, Hulu, any seervice that floods networks with huge amounts of data they promised to their customers should be billed for their bandwidth burden.  And if an ISP needs to substantially expand their infrastructure to hold their high bandwidth traffic AND ALL THE OTHER TRAFFIC THEY CARRY, they should have the right to ask for the originator to help pay for it.

An ISP should rightfully have the option to say, ""Hey, to support your HD video streaming platform on our network, we need to upgrade our infrastructure to support you.  Obviously, we aren't going to do it out of the goodness of our hearts.  We're gonna bill your traffic a percentage to fund this upgrade, if you decline, we'll drop your traffic **(or maybe just charge OUR users extra to access your service which they will then drop)**""  The bold part being what the fear mongering was based off of.

**TLDR:** NN was about making all data equally billable and have equal distribution priority despite not all data being equal.  Some sites/services congest way more than others, impacting all other data.  Some data is more important (financial/banking/trade vs entertainment HD streaming).  NN took away the power for an ISP to bill a company more if they used more data/flooded the network with data.  It also took away the power for ISPs to allow more important traffic priority over the network (traffic that makes the economic world go round.)
","Which government agency should have oversight of the internet? NN moved it from Federal Trade Commission, which breaks up monopolies, to Federal Communications Commission, which oversees... and TAXES public utilities. Look at the taxes on your phone bill. Public utilities are taxed at a higher rate than private property. Stealth taxes are imposed on utilities. All the talking points were about throttling. However there are bigger implications to which agency has dominion, just by the nature and scope of the agency. It’s like watching a magician distract us with sparkly things. Should the internet be taxed? If so, then that should be the headline debate, not bandwidth.

Netflix started taking off and people began streaming absurd amounts of data. Internet providers saw this, recognized it bogged down their networks, and thought about making Netflix pay for this extreme usage. Now follow the money. The owner of Netflix was one of Obama’s biggest donors during his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama returned the favor with the “net neutrality” regulations in 2015 to prevent ISPs from charging Netflix extra. After leaving office Obama called in his kickback to his personal account and got a do-nothing tens of millions of dollars deal from Netflix to “produce content” with no other explanation. Does that pretty much sum it up for you?","Net neutrality was supposed to stop ISP's from taking advantage of customers, I think that was their argument. People were saying ISP's were going to start selling internet ""packages"" like, Social (facebook, twitter ect), Gaming (steam ect) Adult (porn sites) and that you'd get a bill with all the porn sites you visited or some shit....

Reading this back I'm realizing even more just how ridiculous the whole campaign was. The amount of fake news and misinformation was astronomical. ","Basically it was sold as ""net neutrality"" the concept, which is the idea that ISPs cannot charge more for where one goes on the internet, the idea behind that being that nothing would be softly censored by making it outrageously expensive to access.

In reality, the actual Net Neutrality in the US had nothing to do with that at all and was basically just a way to shoehorn full government regulation over the internet under the same antiquated rules that utilities are regulated by.

Those who stood to gain were the biggest corporations with internet assets and infrastructure assets. Those who stood to lose were smaller companies, any possible future competition, and customers. 

Most arguments for NN were made using a lot of tech jargon and moral-high-ground like language, when in reality it's a pretty basic economics and government regulation issue.","Thats what hes saying, theyre hypocrites. They want a free and open internet but are a okay with people being almost completely censored off the internet all together. Hell they want that to happen.","NN had some ability to deplatform, but in much more subtle ways. I think they had to resort to more obvious methods when it was repealed and they lost power.

There were clauses in the NN rules to block or throttle ""unlawful traffic"" which means one hate speech violation and they have justification to remove you from the internet. They were expecting to use these powers when Hillary won.","It has a lot to do with it actually. You'll notice that the big online tech companies really began their push for online censorship after the FCC began regulatory control of the internet.

I am all for ""net neutrality"", that is, that all traffic should be treated the same by those who's bandwidth is being purchased. The FCC regulation wasn't that. It was a shelter for anticompetitive behavior specifically for online tech companies as opposed to ISPs.","No. Someone else died so his bandwidth went up.","I see it differently. With net neutrality, no one was censoring messages by conservatives, or it was being done covertly. Without it, twatter and facespace don't even try to hide it anymore.

It is just a matter of time before posts from The_Donald are going to be set to a lower priority simply to be read or for users who are subscribers to this subreddit have their network throttled compared to more enlightened individuals.

I'm all for freedom in the markets, as long as everybody who desires to be involved in those markets has the freedom to enter those markets and provide free market solutions to problems they perceive.  The problem is that isn't always possible and at what point does some network service start dominating the market to the point they are squelching free speech and pushing voices away even when there are people who want to listen?

Leftists might have been all about ""net neutrality"" when it impacted *their special sites* and data features, but when the shoe is on the other foot they don't care and indeed actively try to silence dissenting views if it isn't their own.  That is why this is such a big deal, and frankly an ISP shouldn't care about what the contents of the data are but instead should simply deliver the data in an agnostic fashion.  It is a free speech issue in that sense.

If ISPs are a dime a dozen and people have the ability to switch between hundreds or thousands of ISPs, then your above argument completely makes sense.  Please help do something so that sort of reality can happen, so your arguments do make sense and free market activities can let one ISP change their service to support video traffic over something else, or a leftist ISP can filter out anything that mentions Donald Trump.... or conservatives can pretend that the Clinton's don't exist.  As long as government supports for restricting the ability of private individuals to set up their own ISP exist though, your arguments fall flat on its face.","But to go beyond that, Net Neutrality never existed anyway, what was actually changed was the classification change for ISPs back to Title I ""information service"" from Title II ""Common Carrier"", after Obama's FCC had changed their classification from Title I to Title II in 2015....","> An ISP should rightfully have the option to say, ""Hey, to support your HD video streaming platform on our network, we need to upgrade our infrastructure to support you.

Well, it wasn't actually fearmongering because it was based off of what we've **already seen** cable companies ACTUALLY do in the past.  Cable companies have been one of the biggest, shittiest monopolies of our time. 
And at the time (obviously not true anymore), Google was viewed as being more trustworthy than greedy as fuck cable monopolies.

Unfortunately, Google and 0bama's commie ass got in bed and created an even more horrifying lovechild than the cable companies.

That said, Net neutrality without an oppressive commie government would be fine, **because unlike what you said, ALL data IS the same.  It's all just 1's and 0's and there's not a single goddamn bit of difference whether you're downloading a movie or a song or jerkin' your gerkin' to some pornhub**, and just because some faggot ISP can't handle 7PM traffic isn't YOUR fault, it's THEIRS and you shouldn't be throttled for bits that are all the exact fucking same.

If you want to let faggot ISPs charge you more to download the same data at the same rate you should be getting anyway, you're a dumbass, and I will have no problems calling anyone a dumbass for letting a company fuck them like that.  
On the other hand, the NN movement was co-opted so wcyd?","The issue is that the only job a ISP has is to provide internet service. They act as a liason between a consumer and a internet product. But then some ISP are also cable/TV providers. So they have an incentive to degrade the service/quality of competing cable/TV/content providers to make theirs look better. The UPS analogy isn't a great example because UPS doesn't sell legal documents or refrigerators. They're in the business of transport. I pay UPS to transport something I want, that's it. Just like I pay Comcast to provide me internet to do whatever I want. If what I choose to do uses a lot of bandwidth, they shouldn't penalize the company I'm interacting with on the internet. If anything, they should raise their service price to provide adequate quality of service. ","It's also an issue of monopolies being unable to provide an adequate service to their customers where no other alternatives remain, and the entire country is witnessing Comcast slowly rape everyone and it's frustrating.
Of course, the fucking communists hijacked the NN movement, so now our choice is government intrusion into the internet, or still getting fucked by Comcast.
Damned if we do, damned if we don't.  At least Comcast only rapes our wallets for now though.","One other issue with that post is that ""conspiring"" is different than matching.  Canada has that problem when it comes to cell phone companies, and the US did before T-Mobile.

One carrier decides to add throttling, or caps, or fees, and the others simply match it.  That's not ""conspiring"", it's ""responding to market demands"".

Exactly like what happened when DNS provider after DNS provider, hosting provider after hosting provider, and DDoS protection service after service blocked Stormfront.  Or, for that matter what we see with attacks on advertisers.  All the advertisers drop the conservative in question not because they ""conspire"", but because they jump on the bandwidth.

Right now, ISPs aren't doing that.  We *need* a law to prevent that *before* that starts being the norm, or we're going to see it start becoming normal to block ""hate speech"", with ""hate speech"" getting progressively leftist.

The internet is absolutely essential to communication, built by the government, and subsidized to the tunes of Billions by taxpayers.  Letting private companies regulate that and censor who's permitted to speak would be like letting the Phone company decide who we can call.  It has a chilling effect on freedom of expression.","They think that free speech doesn't exist as an ideal outside of the first amendment, so as long as you're not being censored by the government it's A OK! And of course, many of them don't even believe in the first amendment and would have it repealed for ""muh hate speech"".","Do you have any reading on this? I'm not saying you're wrong; when articulated like this, it sounds like there is possibly some relevance there.

>I am all for ""net neutrality"", that is, that all traffic should be treated the same by those who's bandwidth is being purchased.

You can support an open internet or a government mandated ""open"" internet. 

What do you think the government is gonna do when they get that power?  Come on man, use your noggin. You think the same government that targeted conservatives with the IRS gives a fuck about conservative voices?  The same government that launched a massive illegal spying campaign on a presidential candidate?  And you want to give them power to regulate the internet?  It baffles me. ","By the government being involved there was a lot of red tape, this red tape meant that new businesses couldn't get started and I'm sure you remember how the old guard was [rapidly](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/att-and-time-warner-reveal-merger-to-create-isp-tv-and-media-giant/) consolidating [themselves](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/08/frontier-completes-its-verizon-deal-and-its-not-go.aspx) into smaller choices that control huge chunks of the US. When you're the only provider in town there is no reason not to add data caps and slow down internet, what is your customer going to do? drop you for a non-existant competitor?

Could they do throttling and other stuff now? sure but as other have pointed out in this thread there are new ISP's popping up all over because the red tape is gone, so if Comcast want to throttle they certainly can but then they will likely lose a ton of revenue to some new company that just opened up last month and is already offering better speeds for half the price.","I think the gist of it was basically this:  
The side FOR NN was arguing ""without regulation, ISP's can simply start charging for fast lanes and restrict content!!! We need to regulate so this doesn't happen!!!"" 
&nbsp;
 
Literally everybody else: ""(shrugging confused) but nobody was talking about that happening? The free market would kill any attempt at that.   Who told you this might happen?""
&nbsp;

FOR NN: ""BUT WITHOUT REGULATION, THEY CAN CHARGE FOR FAST LANES AND RESTRICT CONTENT!!  WHY DO YOU HATE FREE INTERNET?  WE NEED TO REGULATE TO HAVE TRULY FREE INTERNET""","We can both agree that the concept of net neutrality is good, on its face. It means a neutral internet, where freedom to do what you want (within legality) is acceptable. It means you can't make it prohibitively expensive to go to t_d, for instance. You can't ""soft censor"" parts of the internet. You can't charge more for things for political purposes.

We all think that is great.

Two problems. The first is, that was not happening in the first place. The second is, to ""solve"" this ""problem"" (that didn't exist), we must give the government regulatory control of the internet as a utility.

That is what Net Neutrality was about...giving government control over the internet as a utility. It was not about actual net neutrality, the concept. It was just being sold that way. Because all government power grabs are sold as a good thing, otherwise they would never pass.

People literally hate Ajit Pai for saying ""nah, government doesn't need to power grab"". 

Think about that.","Net Neutrality means that ISPs cannot price discriminate against customers for any reason. So for example if Time Warner wanted to charge YouTube or Netflix more per MB of bandwidth because those 2 sites alone push their infrastructure to 70% capacity and force the ISP to upgrade its infrastructure or have other customers experience service outages, they can't do that. It means that in effect YOU pay for upgrades to Time Warner's infrastructure to accomodate traffic to sites that put a disproportionate load on their servers and lines as opposed to those websites paying for the upgrades needed to accommodate them. 

I have no love for ISPs but it seems rather obvious to me why the handful of highly trafficked websites that account for >90% of all web traffic would want to force ISPs to raise rates for EVERYONE instead of just them. It's not free speech, it's a money thing. ","Digital communism is probably the most overly-simplistic and purposefully misleading way of putting it, so sure. Let's say that  
  
Edit: would you call your electric utility company ""communist""? That was essentially what net neutrality was trying to do, they were trying to regulate internet the same way that most states regulate electric utilities.  
Basically, forcing them to be ""kilobyte utilities"".","Is it telephone communism when we make the phone company treat every call the same, charge everyone (mostly) the same, and charge the same rate to call everyone in the same area code?

We went through this with AT&T.  We didn't want the phone company deplatforming conservatives, or charging the Republican party 2x as much for their phone line.  We didn't want the phone company deciding who you can call, or when.  We made them give up ownership of their lines, because AT&T used to require you to only use their phones, or you could give yours to them and rent it from them.

So, if that's electronic communism, then yes, Net Neutrality is digital communism.","well, the basic idea is that ISPs bill per sent unit of data, say 1 KB. Consumers in the US pay for available bandwidth, whether they use it or not, but generally speaking that is how ISPs get paid: by providing use of their infrastructure.

So one would argue that it doesn't matter to them what that 1KB contains. What reason do they have to discriminate between 2 different packets of data? The only reason they would have to do this is anticompetitive; they really only want to shut down competitors to their TV and phone services by charging different rates for different content types. The idea of NN is that they should not be allowed to do that. Fortunately, they cant engage in anticompetitive behavior as per FTC regulation, and there are technical ways to prevent this in the free market with no regulation required, like picking a different ISP, or using SSL/TLS or other encryption schemes to prevent them from knowing the difference between any 2 packets. Regulation is really not needed for NN.

What the tech companies like Netflix, Google anf FB wanted was ""NN"", that is, they wanted to not have to pay for their use of bandwidth. They have to roll this down the line to their customers, driving the price for their services up (with the free market, which is fair) and so they wanted to argue that it is in the interest of the ISPs to not do it since the use of these services accounts for ISPs user base for the most part. They wanted a special privilege as a content provider, and this would put other content providers at an artificial disadvantage, not only that, but it would create a situation on the internet where there are content providers and users, as opposed to how it actually works, peers communicating over a network. They were calling this NN, but it is the opposite of NN.

The other big thing is that the internet is regulated as a marketplace by the FTC. It was regulated that way before the FCC began regulating it in 2014 as a common carrier. This puts online tech companies in a position where they are sheltered from the FTCs antitrust regulation. This allows them to curate content (which is practically indistinguishable from censoring content), which again, goes against NN the concept. If they are subject to FTC regulation they can be sued for anticompetitive behavior. They still can pick what they themselves publish (netflix or hulu), and Youtube is getting away with censoring user generated content for now, but it is something they could get in trouble for, which is why they wanted ""NN"" which isn't actually neutral at all.

I have quite a few links in my post history from 2017, I was very vocal about this. Especially during the bullshit astroturfing. You can find all kinds of info about it now by searching online. in 2017 the astroturfing was so ubiquitous it was damn near impossible to find an article critical of the NN regulation by the FCC, so some of us actually had to read the regulation and talk about it.","Nice goalposts shift.

Seriously though - that would be amazing if a bulk of americans had actual competition. And a lot of people don't realize Net Neutrality was a HUGE field opener in a lot of ways - ISP competititon essentially collapsed in 2005 because of the removal of Title II rules.

&#x200B;

Comcast and my cable co have side by side but not overlapping jurisdictions. I live near the line and can only get the one on my side of the line. This is because of laws comcast lobbied for. I was willing to pay for comcast to run a line at one point but they couldn't legally do it. (When verizon ended DSL service here and our cable co didn't have internet yet) ..... so I was stuck on dialup for a year because competition wasn't allowed.

&#x200B;

Both raised rates $50/month as soon as the NN repeal went through, and content packages and zero-rating are still a thing on IP services. (There was a price control provision) - oh, and regulatory compliance fees went up. That's just a sudden $50/mo spike that happened almost across the country in areas with single ISPs.

From their WAN interface they then choose what goes in (or out) by going with an ISP. Once data leaves the WAN port to the ISP, the ISP is in charge of how that Data is moved and transferred. The Hospital/Doctor has no say on this other than they chose that ISP to begin with. They will have a contract with that ISP to guarantee up times or acceptable use policy at a price point. That is it.   


I pay for ISP for the same thing but on a smaller scale.   


Data is not equal. It will never be equal. Research Tier 1 data is absolutely given priority over Porn and Netflix. Packet prioritization is a thing and has been for a long time. Medical Data is given priority. This is how the Internet world works. Attend a Supercomputer Conference or watch the online videos to find out just how misinformed  you may actually be. ",">Haha o.k man, you do you. All data is the same, the amount of data a service requires and the speed that is required to deliver it in a consistent, consumable manner doesn't matter.


And that's an ISP's problem, not mine.  If they cannot handle the traffic, then that's on them for being greedy and signing up too many customers that it ended up resulting in bad service.  That's Business 101.  Charging customers more BECAUSE you have bad service?  Now that's Business 110.
You don't seat more customers at a restaurant than you have seats.

It still doesn't change the fact that all bits are the same, dawg.
""Wahhhhhhh, Comcast doesn't provide a good enough service so let's just ban Netflix"" - that's what some people in here are sounding like.","Oh yeah NN has always been shilled for hard as fuck on here. One of the funniest things I've ever seen on Reddit was when even subreddits like /r/cars had that one Net Neutrality article that was botted to the top of every single sub as the #1 post on a subreddit about CARS.

The take home message is that social media companies think if they work together to push propaganda hard enough they can get you the user to fight their battles for them, they think it's their duty to humanity to shape your opinions on political issues to become more like they are. 

I mean look what Google/FB/Twitter does to conservative activists - nobody even bats an eye over corporate censorship anymore. Most people - myself included - probably don't even realize how bad it is (ever tried to find a non-current news story on Google that doesn't fit into the leftist mold of reality and been confounded that you just couldn't find it anymore? They DEFINITELY memory hole stuff left and right.)","You can say FULL STOP all you want. That doesn't make it remotely true in the world of the ISP and data management packet priority is a thing. 

No...you aren't suing any one about it. ","Yes, they are private. We are not talking about the private/public distinction here. I am talking about control, not ownership. Electric utilities started out government-run and then were sold off to cronies when it was obvious they couldn't run them well.

> The $220 billion industry, which has been called the last great government-sanctioned monopoly, is slowly but surely being deregulated

Deregulation is a move towards freedom, but it doesn't mean that an enterprise tightly controlled by the government is not socialistic in nature.

Does this sound like capitalism to you?

> 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), which gave big utilities a monopoly in their geographic area but prevented them from expanding their reach.","You're looking at it from a predatory monopolistic ISP who can't cater to the needs of all of their customers' perspective and has to downgrade their own service to some of their other customers because of it.
I'm looking at it from a consumer's standpoint.  My opinion as a customer paying full price for a product is every bit as valid.

No one's going to argue that a hospital shouldn't be able to transmit quickly, but I would argue that it's wrong to charge a hospital MORE based on WHICH data they are sending.  For exmaple, charging a hospital more money for sending the same number of bits, simply because it's an X-ray instead of an MP3.  This is what I mean when I say discriminating against data is retarded.","Are you high? Because you obviously didn't read. PUHCA was created to break up the large privately-held utilities.  The deal was that they would be broken into smaller utilities with stronger regulation but they would get a natural monopoly.  
So, ORIGINALLY, THEY WERE PRIVATE, not govt run. They never sold them off  
  
Edit:  so, in your world Ma Bell(AT&T) and the baby bells are communist?  
  
PUHCA was the AT&T breakup of that era. It was a monopoly-bust. It wasn't the sale of govt utilities to private companies  
They ""regulated"" the utilities because they couldn't figure out a method for competition back then we barely have one now. Deregulation is a mess and while it does create a market, it still requires heavy price-setting and it drives up costs rather than driving them down","But did you say FULL STOP yet? Make to tell them you have the ""FULL STOP"" button going! 

As someone who manages a tier one research data center in higher education, operates two full IT management firms (both in the medical and government area) you are absolutely wrong! ",">h in the medical and government area) you are absolutely wrong!

Also, I'd like to add, what I'm suggesting is that I also believe it would be wrong to discriminate against a hospital and charge them extra for sending the same 5MB file, simply because it's an x-ray instead of an MP3.

If I'm a company and I'm looking to take on a HUGE client, I make sure that my system and infrastructure is able to meet the needs and demands of that company.  I don't just ram through without any lube because I'm a monopoly and well fuck, we can just make everyone else's service bad instead.  If it isn't, I either invest in some new infrastructure capable of meeting the demands of high capacity clients, or I don't take on the job.  Every other business works this way.

Meanwhile, the hospital has no choice but to accept the hit because there's only one ISP in town.  Whereas, if there was more competition in a \*healthy\* free market this wouldn't even be a problem.  A hospital in that kind of environment would just tell a cable company to get bent if they wanted to charge them extra simply because the \*arrangement\* of bits that gets translated by a computer is somehow different from literally any other arrangements of bits of the exact same size.

Does that make sense?",">But did you say FULL STOP yet? Make to tell them you have the ""FULL STOP"" button going! 

I'm sorry for your feelings.  Sorry for having a strong opinion about something and that you don't like that phrase. 

Spez: Spez.

>As someone who manages a tier one research data center in higher education, operates two full IT management firms (both in the medical and government area) you are absolutely wrong! 

Oh so your job depends on this bullshit.  That makes sense.  Higher education is a clusterfuck and the fact that your'e using it as an example for anything positive is fucking hilarious.","From the article you cited, dipshit.  
  
>The origins of the current system of energy production and delivery date back to the New Deal era, when Congress brought an end to the tight reign of large interstate holding companies that controlled more than 75 percent of the country’s electric generating capacity. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) forced the holding companies to break up, and gave utilities a government-sanctioned monopoly over a limited territory.   
  
What do you think a ""holding company"" is? 
  
Don't be mad just because you don't know shit about the utility industry. I've only been working in it for 15 years.",">Name calling..got it. Good luck. 

I mean, you kinda started it because you got triggered by my FULL STOP and decided to mock me for it.  So, what do you expect?  
Cry some more?  Some things I have a firm opinion about based on principle.  If I find out that a company is giving someone undue preferential treatment, I'm not gonna use it.  But when they're the only option in town, it becomes a monopoly problem and opens them up to lawsuits.  You don't seem to understand that part, or the fact that NONE of this would be an issue if hospitals had more than one ISP to choose from in the first place.

Edit: Don't act like ISPs haven't astroturfed AGAINST NN for their own benefit.  It was Google vs Cable monopolies and then Obama's communist ass got involved.","What are you even trying to say?  

Here are the facts:  
Originally the utility companies were large and private.  
Govt broke them up into smaller private companies, but guaranteed them monopoly.  
In exchange for the monopoly, they had to submit to regulated pricing  
  
At this point, you might be able to make some kind of quasi ""socialist"" argument. However, I would argue that is a stretch. A regulated private company is very different from a nationalized company.   
The companies are still owned by individuals and able to make a profit.  

The solution made sense(allowing them to keep their monopoly) because competition was basically impossible or would be very limited. A company would just buy out their competition rather than waste money competing.
  
On the topic of the ISPs, net neutrality was only similar in that they were trying to argue that since a natural duopoly existed, they should at least regulate the rules of the market.   
No matter what company you buy electricity from, you still have to follow standard rules. These are known as your interconnection agreement. These rules exist for both you and the utility."
