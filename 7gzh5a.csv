","The same people on the internet begging and screaming for net neutrality just years ago are now opposed to it. Why you ask? Because trump told them to be - this is the real damage done by trump, the acceptance of anything he does without question. Any time he says news is fake, that an immigrant group is bad, that a candidate isn't tough on crime, millions of people take that as fact, without any critical thought or fact finding. Shameful.","And we know all the good internet companies were all founded after 2015. ","Yet ISPs can STILL throttle your internet even with Title II","ITT: But Obama put Pai on the FCC... despite having to because the Republicans wanted them there, but that's beside the point because then be couldn't push the false 'Obama did everything bad' narrative.","Somehow losing net neutrality will STILL be Obama's fault","Trump’s Ajit Pai and thus Trump himself definitely sold us to the telecom companies.

most of those popular internet streaming places will feel the brunt of it anyway as they will have to pay up or customers will have to pay up to watch their stuff reliably probably","Seriously, these posts today have made me want to be against net neutrality if this is the shit people do with it. ","It took the entire internet to get his attention for it, but whatever.","So much astroturfing below. The talking points currently being pushed are:

1) Flynn was Obama's mistake somehow

2) Net neutrality was killed by Obama for reasons

3) Democrats want everything to be about Russia","Remind me who appointed Ajit Pai to Commisioner of the FCC again?","> The same people on the internet begging and screaming for net neutrality just years ago are now opposed to it. Why you ask? Because trump told them to be 

So you're making up stories? This didn't happen. You just made it up. ","The president is required to appoint at least 2 people nominated by the other party. The GOP nominated Ajit Pai, and Obama had to appoint him.","Presidents must nominate FCC Commissioners on a 3-2 basis out of bipartisanship. In this case Obama got the Republican recommendation from Mitch McConnell. While Wheeler announced his plans in 2015 for Title II rules Ajit Pai expressed his discontent yet was not able to do anything about it. In 2017 Trump re-nominated Pai as FCC Chairman fully aware of Pai's interests.

In short, Obama did not nominate Pai as Chairman, and Pai would have been out of the FCC if Trump did not re-select him. Trump is 100% liable.","I assume you're referring to Ajit Pai, current head, and no, Trump appointed him to be Chairman of the FCC, not Obama.

If you're referring to Pai having previously been an FCC Commissioner, you're still wrong as the President does not appoint the Commissioner seats, those are appointed by Congress, with 2 going to the minority and 3 to the majority party of which the President appoints one to be Chair.","He did, but his administration also put net neutrality laws in place. It took a ton of public prompting and you bet your ass they didn't want to because of that sweet bribe money, but in the end the administration did side with the people. In the sad state this country is in where only rich folks or businesses make the rules, that was a pretty big deal.","The president is required to appoint at least 2 people nominated by the other party. The GOP nominated Ajit Pai, and Obama had to appoint him","Slightly misleading. 

He was appointed Commissioner by then President Barrack Obama in 2012.

>2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.

>2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.

>2007-2009 - AT&T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.

>2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)

>2011-2013, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace

>2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)

>2012, AT&T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.

>2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

>The foundation of Reason's argument is that Net Neutrality is unnecessary because we've never had issues without it. I think this timeline shows just how crucial it really is to a free and open internet.","The reason this cake into being was that ISPs were starting to abuse customers and artificially control content and boost their prices. The rules were just starting to really be needed. Now they are desperately needed because these companies are paying millions in lobbying tp get the ability to fully abuse what is basically their monopolies on high speed web access.","https://yro.slashdot.org/story/07/07/26/168202/deep-packet-inspection-and-net-neutrality

There was also a period (personal anecdote) where YouTube videos would not fucking buffer. I had to go through a proxy to get the videos to load normal. I had at the time 150 mbps download. There is no fucking reason that YouTube should have been loading slow back then.

Just because you personally are not aware of the issue, doesn't mean it wasn't an issue.

The shaping of the packets you request could be so incredibly slight, you might not have even noticed but they can kill a website. Make something take a few more second to load, and someone just might leave that website, and someone loses that traffic. That is a good way to hurt competitors in an almost hardly detectable way.

Plus, why would internet providers be lobbying so hard, and spending so much money, if they didn't plan to profit hugely off the death of net neutrality?","Hey, only Net Neutrality in these comments please you're disrupting the circlejerk.

But please don't read it just repost stuff k?","Pai is just a republican goon.  Any other republican would be doing the same thing.  Obama had to appoint a republican because the committee has to be bi-partisan.  The guy Obama put in charge enacted title 2 protections.  The guy Trump put in charge is trying to get rid of title 2.  That is all there is to it.  Implying that Pai is Obama's fault is ignorant and misleading.  Pure propaganda and fake news.","To be fair he was following McConnell's recommendation who at the time was the minority leader. This also happened 3 years before net neutrality laws were passed. There was no way he could have seen this coming at that time.","The president is required to appoint at least 2 people nominated by the other party. The GOP nominated Ajit Pai, and Obama had to appoint him","Ajit Pai is a meme. ","No, Obama didn't make him the head of the FCC.  Perhaps you should google this easily found information.  

Also you might learn EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN voted for him.  

But let's blame one guy, Obama, for not realizing what a sack of shit Pai would be once Republicans had control.  Because that is what is enabling him, not Obama. 

","How many fucking times do I have to clarify this to people. There is longstanding tradition for partisan committee members to be appointed at the recommendation of others in house/congress. In this case, McConnell requested Pai and Obama nominated him. Ultimately, trump is the one responsible for choosing him to lead the FCC. Stop with this revisionist history bullshit!"," Consider that Ajit is a GOPer and was highly recommended by the Senate majority leader and subsequently a unanimous thumbs up from the Senate.  Obama was likely doing some bi-partisan song and dance to keep even keel.  

 This man is an ex Verizon counselor and under the spell of the industry, money, and his boss the Trumpster.  Personally I put him in the same camp as Sessions, Bannon and the rest of the crazy kooks running this place.","True, but it's way better than turning a blind eye to the FCC making millions of clearly phony accounts to say they love Comcast fucking us in the ass.","Would you rather have the guy appoint a Verizon exec from the get go to compromise the system from within?

Those were Republican bills that were opposed by most Democrats and Democratic leadership. You can hardly blame Obama for them. No doubt had they come to his desk he would've VETOed them.

Snowden is a fair criticism of Obama if you're a big believer in public whistle-blowing, but is irrelevant to Net Neutrality.","I believe courtesy, but even if he rejected Pai they'd nominate another ideologically similar candidate. ","You make me feel bad for Comcast, the company that shits on competition through lobbying and legislation, making it in many areas the only ISP of choice. They instead also get to feel what it's like to be fucked by the government, so it's pretty damn satisfying and until internet providers can operate in a free market, I hope net neutrality stays. ","Maybe he based his decision on the fact that those shit companies have monopolized the market and have no inncentive to provide better service to their customers...","So? Someone else who would have done the exact same things for the telecom companies and Republicans would have been nominated instead.

Edit:- Reply to the comment below.

Keep in mind that this is a foreigner's point of view. Having said that, the tweets from the top man alone is enough to make this government a good source of entertainment, but not credible facts. Bundled with that are the Russia investigations. And until and unless the investigations prove the administration to be squeaky clean and isn't swept under the rug, I won't be inclined to believe anything coming out of the WH is nothing but a last ditch attempt to change the topic of discussion.","There is a limit, Americans do regrettably represent the government they elected and we have been routinely brought up as a pariah by certain politicians. I personally, have had enough. 

Edit: again I am not saying that I dislike Americans in general I am just saying that moving to Canada will not solve the underlying problem, only exacerbate it. ","Yes that's true that our enemy is embedded within the populous but if our government kills 2 terrorist but in the process accidentally kills 5 civilians with the terrorist then the terrorist organization can easily recruit more soldiers to fight for their cause because it looks justified. And it's easier to rack up those kills when you have someone pressing a button to drop a bomb that is nowhere near the battlefield.

I prefer drone strikes when they are guaranteed terrorists targets only but for the most part I know this isn't a popular opinion but I would rather prefer boots on the ground for the precision. Sorry for the long reply and sorry for the misunderstanding earlier. 

Oh definitely if Obama would have sent boots on the ground I think he would have caught hell from both sides. The dems because they are obviously anti-war and the republicans beucase he's Obama. "
