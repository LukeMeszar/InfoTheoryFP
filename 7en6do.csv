Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality.  It is good to hear from you.

 

As you may know, President Clinton and a Republican Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to preserve free market competition on the Internet.  This bipartisan legislation recognized the importance of Internet competition for American consumers, workers, and businesses in a fast-paced, globalized economy.  As a result, the United States has the most successful and innovative Internet and technology companies in the world.  In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) narrowly voted to adopt “net neutrality” regulations that restrict Internet Service Providers’ (ISPs) ability to manage content.  The FCC argued that it had this authority under 1930s legislation designed to govern telegraph companies and nearly extinct telephone lines.

 

On November 27, 2017, the FCC issued a draft proposal to return to the Clinton administration’s Internet regulatory framework.  The FCC will consider adopting the draft proposal in mid-December.  In earlier statements, the FCC cited the harmful impact of the 2015 regulations, noting that government interference has led to a 5.6% decrease in ISP investments, which translates to lost jobs, fewer choices, and slower speeds for consumers.  The FCC also observed that thousands of rural Internet providers have been forced to close following the 2015 regulations.  

 

I believe that consumers are most empowered when providers are allowed to manage their networks without excessive government interference.  Net neutrality regulations, no matter how well intentioned, stifle competition in the industry and restrict consumer choices.  Across many industries, we have seen that more regulations stifle consumer choice and make it more difficult for new companies to emerge on a fair playing field.  I am sorry we disagree on this issue.  Healthy debate is a benchmark of a free republic and we are lucky to live in a nation that protects open discourse.  Rest assured that I will keep your views in mind as I continue to monitor the FCC’s rulemaking process.  

 

Again, thank you for contacting me, and please stay in touch as I continue fighting for all Hoosiers so they can build better lives for themselves and their families.

 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Todd Rokita
Member of Congress

As we are on the cusp of a repeal of net neutrality I believe strongly that this is a turning point for Republican politics in the long term.  My steadfast loyalty to the Republic party has been resolute due to my steadfast believe in a party platform of personal ethics, responsibility and freedom.  However a steadfast faith in free market economics (in general) should not be confused with a belief in market anarchy.

The nature of internet neutrality is not hostile to the free market unless we are absolutely devoid of nuance in our appreciation of the market.  Even a fan favorite Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, understood that there are certain protections for the spirit of free enterprise that must guarantee a de facto fair trading place if we can expect the merits of a free market to rule.

Consumers do not have the power to choose a different supply if the majority of a primary resource is controlled by a de facto aristocracy like a fief who does not rely on the traditional rules we come to expect that allows clear winners and losers to emerge.  In smalltown Louisiana a simple matter of anti-business, anti-competitor practices carried out by super chains create an economic dependency where choice is robbed of the consumer, because a manipulation of resources guarantees that the success or failure of a local market is irrelevant, because national and international resources will be pumped into defeating competition until the consumer is left with only a single choice.

This Wal-Mart Effect is a dangerous possibility with the repeal of internet neutrality.  The internet in its earliest days was a luxury of those that could afford personal PCs, leisure time, and the chance to browse an emerging technology.  So much of our cultural, economic, and social strata is now definitively affected by our access to the internet.  Most of our president's decrees, in fact, are more accessible through the internet than traditional press means.

And with this murky territory that the internet exists in, somewhere between a service and a utility, the Republican Party, as the majority holders in Congress and the ""face"" of current domestic policy, are in effect telling the people of the United States that this borderline utility, even our very access to the President's preferred method of communication, should be arbitrated by private holding gatekeepers.  This amounts to, quite literally, the digital age's equivalence of emerging railroad barons, who guarantee access for the few that enrich the already industrious elite, on the back of infrastructure that is consistently already facilitated by public means.

The repeal of internet neutrality is a matter that will, indisputably, occur in the future.  Aristocratic style monopolies have never existed in perpetuity and the dangerous tycoon fostering that the FCC's proposed revocation will insure guarantees that in time this FCC repeal *will* be overturned.

However in that time the Republican Party will have suffered the irreparable damage of being the facilitators of this madness.  The historic damage will be done and after 8 years of the face of Democrats the Republicans, in their first year of power, will have tarnished their reputation so thoroughly that in future films casting directors will ask for Bella Lugosi look alikes to play the Republican leaders in biopics about this event.

If the Republican Party hopes to retain seats and my loyalty they must demonstrate that they believe in the principles of a fair market, not the creation of a nobility class that controls one of the most important means of communication and business in our time so that anti-capitalist exploits will keep us in a digital dark age.

I implore you to use anything within your power to block this attempt to repeal net neutrality in the spirit of Republican values.","I've been thinking about this whole thing, and actually I've decided I don't give a fuck about net neutrality getting repealed or not. American ISPs and cable companies are the cancer of America, we all know that, and shit has to change to make them better. On the other hand, I don't really care if they charge me for individual services. I'm already paying $150/month for 100up/down, and it crashes like 4x a day. It's not like they're gonna start charging $500/month suddenly. If they charge for extra shit, the price will remain about the same for me, maybe $200/month at worst and I don't care about that. I care that they haven't really updated their infrastructure since the 80s, most of America is not covered by fiber, and the companies are really fucking shitty and evil","It is good to see that the push-back against net neutrality abolishment is getting so much traction. I am not sure if there has ever been an initiative so unpopular with the public, many times rebuked, yet that is nonetheless pushed forward, again and again, by giant corporate buaurocracies and corrupt officials.


Many of the evils that killing off net neutrality would bring about have already been mentioned in many threads. The biggest one seems to be only glossed about though. In my view, the whole fight is primarily about the control of information flow. This is way bigger and way more important than, for example, charging fees for access, although that too is a part of the same game.


Control of information can take very insidious forms. The goal is to dismantle the internet as a free for all competition of ideas where corporate powers (ISPs and their affiliates) do not have an automatic, insurmountable advantage. The game is not rigged enough in their favour, which is why we are seeing repeated attempts to move the goal posts. 


Imagine a future internet where you are not able to create an accessible website or blog unless you sign an agreement that all content you put online will be reviewed by your ISP, and obviously confined to a list of pre-approved topics. If you want to stay afloat, you will be well advised to show proper ideological fervor by peppering your site with grassroots slogans such as: ""Comcast is great!"", ""Corporations are cuddly people"", or ""In ISP, we trust."". All with a smile on your face, lest you be thought as an enemy of the system.","If the government shuts down your internet freedom, shut down your government!
","If I missed something and this is not the case I'm sorry.

If this were to pass and ISPs were to skyrocket the price, wouldn't everyone dropping the internet package show them how stupid this is and force their hand to go back before it passed? I mean sure that would suck immensely and waste a lot of time(not to mention probably kill Reddit) but would that not be a last ditch effort if this were to happen?","Warning, unpopular Opinion!

People largely don't understand Net Neutrality and its potential impact.  You want to know why ISPs want it gone?  Because part of Net Neutrality puts ISPs under the same umbrella as telephone and power: a controlled monopoly.  Because of this, Comcast can't roll into where Verizon is, and tiny startups can't roll into either of their territory, they instead lease the lines which are being used in the areas they don't control, if they offer services at all.  In addition, because of this, our internet speed average is markedly lower than other countries.  We also have been blocked from getting things like city-wide free broadband because of the impact it would have on Net Neutrality.  Finally, while everyone things that this is going to make the internet be carved up like some Dish Network combo platter, realize that 1) doing so to a not-small part of the internet is impractical, 2) that access, or lack thereof, would be controlled by your DNS which you can manually change, and 3) would ultimately hurt the bottom lines of companies when you could use indepentant companies who wouldn't do that anyway.

I also urge you to truly understand the situation and not give into groupthink.","Here's what I just wrote and sent to their inboxes, feel free to use if you like it:

There is a very strong chance that you won't even bother reading this, but I cannot leave things unsaid during a time when such an important issue is going to be voted on. I have always been proud to be an American citizen, with our flaws and our strengths. This last year has been a shameful nightmare for the American people. The people in power and influence aren't even trying to be discreet with their selfish ambitions, and its the voters and citizens who will suffer for the benefit of someone else.

Net Neutrality is not some evil scheme by the Democrats; Obama is not some sort of supervillain whose wake of terror and malice has to be repealed and cleaned up. The diversity between the two major political parties in this country is worse than ever. Politicians don't care to better this country for all, they only care about their team having the most points. It's a disgusting way to live and it hurts all of us. This current issue is only the most recent disgrace to come to the attention of Congress to pass through. There is no advantage to giving a handful of major ISP companies the right to extort money for access to the internet. There are countries that have free internet service and there are countries that consider internet access a basic human right these days. The United States won't even consider water a basic human necessity, for the sake of a company that won't spare any expense to make more money.

Repealing Net Neutrality is just handing the keys to a daycare center to a famously aggressive and unsympathetic bully. These bullies want more control, more money, and they don't care who they have to harm to get it. The fact that multiple, countless fake identities were made to spread false information to promote the repealing of Net Neutrality should indicate that this is an evil, amoral and twisted idea that even its promoters are aware of. If this was good for the the people of this country at all, there would be actual support of it.

I am so ashamed to have to live in a country where the people are going unheard, and blatantly self-serving laws are being passed. Net Neutrality is one idea that was already voted against, and here we are again, begging and pleading for some rational thought and compassion to find the hearts of the people that determine the fate of this country that we all live in.

Are we citizens of this country, or are we marks for companies to take for all we have? Net Neutrality isn't even the beginning, but with every selfish law being passed that puts the boot to the necks of the citizens, we find ourselves inching closer to the end. This once great country may not even survive another ten years. I can barely see the light of hope in the darkness that grows greater every day.

If this law passes, and we the people are subject to the whims of a few greedy businesses, you may as well change “We the People” to “We the Corporations.”

For the love of decency, for the sake of a brighter future, for the chance that future generations may transform our country into a great nation once again, I beg you to see reason. Net Neutrality must not be repealed. Make me, and others, proud to be American citizens once again.

Our current president vowed to make America great again. He's going the wrong way.","Having to input a phone number on a website to protect your right to internet privacy is an oxymoron.","With the current net neutrality rules, internet is regulated as a ""common carrier"", such as other utilities such as power, water, TV, etc. This means that the ISP's are prohibited from providing ""fast lanes"" to content that the ISP chooses and throttling or even blocking content that they choose.

If these rulings are revoked, then you give the ISP power to choose what you see on the internet. Your ISP essentially becomes EA. The websites you thought would be included in the base price are hidden behind an additional paywall, except unlike Battlefront 2, you cant earn those websites over time.

If you don't think this would happen, look at the previous actions done by ISP's. Verizon has sued many times to allow data throttling, data preference, requiring Netflix to pay them a huge chunk of cash to allow for better streaming to customers, and so on. To make things worse, the current FCC chair is the previous top lawyer by Verizon, and it's clear he's still in cahoots with them.

TLDR If the rules change, your internet will become like cable TV/Battlefront 2. The websites you want to see will require separate paid packages to view them","how bout u go an fuck off my internet Ajit Pai u peice of shit u think I need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about net neutrality who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here","And the propaganda goes on.

Slashing ""net neutrality rules"" does not allow ISPs to do any of that. If it did, they would have done it before 2015, and they didn't.

>Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today

Net neutrality is not a ""principle"", it's a set of unnecessary regulations. It was created in 2015...the internet was around for decades beforehand, so it's literally impossible for it to have ""shaped the internet"". It doesn't even exist outside the USA (news flash, the internet exists outside the USA).

>It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

MUH BIG INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS!!! Net neutrality prevents none of these things and there is no evidence supporting this claim. There is however ample evidence of liberal websites censorship of dissenters (like being banned for understanding the truth about NN).

>the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money.

No, they have been spending money to kill net neutrality because regulations kill business.


>Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC,
>Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public.

So this entire idiotic movement is based on a conspiracy theory.


>People from across the political spectrum are outraged, 

Just the ignorant ones.




Most arguments for NN and against its repeal are not evidence-based, but based on made up fearmongering scenarios that have never happened. Here I address some of the main talking points.

>Net Neutrality was the unspoken but observed rules of the road in times past.

No it wasn't. It didn't exist before 2015. Even if it was the ""unspoken rules"", when were these ""unspoken rules"" broken, so that they suddenly needed to be codified into regulations in 2015?

What you're saying doesn't even make sense. It's like saying Affirmative Action was the ""unspoken rule"" before 1961, and Kennedy just decided to make it a law for no reason. Labor laws were ""unspoken rules"" before being enacted! 

Laws and regulations are (and should be) made in response to things, not ""just because"". Affirmative action was implemented **in response** to racial discrimination. Labor laws were put into place **in response** to unfair employer practices. Net Neutrality was implemented for some reason **just because** it was an ""unspoken rule"" that was never broken? Please.

>As bigger and bigger monopolies came to be ISPS (cable companies) they started to experiment monetizing the traffic

No they didn't.

>Sure they can; look at neflix and Comcast. They basiclly proved it. 

No they didn't.

>Title 2 is there to stop providers from extorting companies and snuffing out small players. 

No it's not. Title 2 is an anti-discrimination clause specifically designed to prevent racial discrimination by phone carriers (it was written in 1934).

Title II: **SEC. 202. [47 U.S.C. 202] DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES. (a) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.**

Taken in context, Title II is 100% about racism and preventing phone companies from discriminating against black people. Simple. It's irrelevant in 2017 and there is no evidence it's needed. It should be easy to gather such evidence, there was no net neutrality before 2015. So show me this time when ISP's were unscrupulously charging fees for some services and not for others...the so called justification for Title II in 2017...i'm waiting.

>Service providers would love to do it like mobile with metered Internet and data caps on customers,

They already do that. Net Neutrality doesn't prevent ISP's from metering data or implementing data caps across all users. Comcast already has a 1TB data cap.

>then extort money from Internet sites at the same time.

Prove it.

>This is about monopolies extending their physical access into a tax on our culture and speech. They must be regulated because they will try to tax every packet then turn that power into propaganda to keep the sheep in line.

Prove it.


By definition (for the sheep) -

Net Neutrality = regulations

Removing regulations = opening internet

Placing regulations = restricting internet

Pretty simple. Unless you are the former FCC chair, then NET NEUTRALITY IS NOT REGULATIONS, ITS LIKE THE FIRST AMENDMENT!!

Or encourage innovation? Why doesn't the government regulate the price of bread?

2) the wired internet service providers are garbage and all this law does in increase the cost of entry which reduces their competition. since they dont need to compete as hard but also have to spend money on compliance, the industry saw a 6% decline in infrastructure investment after the 2015 law was passed; declines never occurred outside recessions before the law.

3) these garbage isps provided an average broadband internet connection of 2mbs in 2007. today the average is 27mbs. tmobile1 wireless internet/phone is $70 for one person and offers 50 gigs of 4g and then throttles down to a unlimited 20mbs 3g connection, and comes with a free netflix account. the real way to punish the isps isnt with the government, but by switching to the mobile providers. they will get more money and then can actually fund even better services.

4) the shittier the isps make their broadband internet, the more likely people will leave their service and hopefully be smart enough to switch to mobile. if you give the broadband isps the freedom to treat you badly while there are viable alternatives, and then they do treat you badly, return the favor and stop giving them your money, and/or start a new internet service provider (whats stopping the billion dollar companies of nflx, amzn, etc. from doing what goog is trying to do? what would incentivize them to do it?)

","Ajit Pai is very articulate and sensible in his arguments against Net Neutrality. 

Here is a quote of his criticism against Internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they dislike are non-existent: ""The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it's all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality.""

This wiki copypasta disproves most of the echo chamber comments against Ajit Pai. Proves Wikipedia editors are smarter than the average redditor. 

Net Neutrality is a Silicon Valley corporate campaign against TeleCommunication companies control over pricing of ISP and data speed. 

Google/Facebook/Netflix and other websites vs. AT&T/Comcast/Verizon and other broadband. 

This does not affect the consumer in any significant way. NN is unnecessary regulation. The internet is not broken. Leave it alone. 
(Notice that NN is heavily promoted on Reddit and other social media figures)","Net neutrality = no innovation... Less government regulation is always a good thing

","A quarter billion dollar website, owned by a multi-billion dollar publishing conglomerate, carpet bombing its users, pushing the narrative for more government regulation. Not fishy at all...","Something doesn't smell right...

First false information in a formula:

""these big companies support net neutrality, so it's bad"", then they proceed to list companies that are actually AGAINST NN.

https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/net_neutrality/

VERIZON, ATT, COMCAST have all lobbied excessively AGAINST NN.

There is a reason. You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.

There is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.","People spamming net neutrality shit has pissed me off more than Comcast ever has. ""net neutrality"" (read: more government control of internet) didn't exist in its current form until 2 years ago and 3 years ago wasn't the end of the world.

This should be a case study on how to trigger people who don't know anything about a subject into hysteria.

","I wish Reddit practiced net neutrality. They don't treat all data equally. ","I think net neutrality should go. For real. Just like graduate students should be taxed for waived tuitions. If you can't get out on the streets and disrupt life for everyone, you have it coming. The average person doesn't even know; of course, he doesn't even know. You think the average person in USA has time to be 'informed'? What do you think the majority of the Americans are? Aware? 

Tell me, when was the last online petition on any significant matter successful? Your representatives have already made up their minds. They will either oppose it or support it but it will not be because of your 'voice' because your 'online voice' is as harmless as air leaking out of the tires of an old car that no one cares to drive. 

50000 people will sign the petition? 100000? 10000000000? Can you get 100 people to write to their ISP and demand that either they support net neutrality or lose them as customers? No, because that's inconvenient. 

Well, have fun and good luck with 'your petition'. ","Time to address some misconceptions about Net neutrality and the law that will kill it. TLDR is killing net neutrality is a pro consumer move and benefits a segment of consumers who currently cannot afford internet services in its current prices. People believe following things will happen when the law will be passed.

1) ISP will chose winners and losers for content that is consumed. The content creators who pay the ISP will have unrestricted path to consumers while those that do not pay will have throttled speed or completely denied services. This effect will be experienced by each and every consumer.
While I agree that this is something that the ISP's CAN do but there is no evidence to suggest that they WILL do it. ISP's are profit driven entities and the only thing they care about are profits. By restricting content for every consumer the ISP's risk losing a big chunk of consumers who value unrestricted access. 

2) The prices for using internet services will go up for ALL consumers.
Again, while I agree the prices for consumers who want unrestricted access might go up a little bit, the prices for those are ok with restricted access will have lower prices. ISP's are monopoly market but you cannot increase the price infinitely without losing consumers. If they could have done that then would have done it already, Net neutrality or not.

What will happen is this law will allow ISP's to start charging content creators for using their bandwidth. This means more revenue to ISP for no additional cost. This means more profit margin. ISP are monopoly markets because of high capital cost and low profit margin. When a monopoly markets transitions from high capital cost/low profit margin to high cap cost/high profit margin then it encourages entry of new players and a competitive market means better price points for consumers in long term.

What will happens for consumers? There will be two tiers of plans - a free internet plan for low price consumers who will have restricted /throttled usage. This service will be sponsored by content creators who will happily do it because it will mean higher traffic to their content. Second plan will be paid plan, these costumers will have unrestricted access to all content since they are paying for their services. Think of this like how Spotify works - free users see ads, paid users don’t see ads.

Now you may ask, but ISP are monopoly market they can universally throttle/restrict services to all customers because they know customers have nowhere to go. This is not true, although the market currently is monopoly but by resorting to anti-consumer practices you will risk losing customers 
1) Cutting the cord and switching to dish/mobile internet. Not everyone will do this because of current speed restrictions but those who value free internet over speed (significant portion of us do) will switch. 
2) Entry of new players who will be willing to provide more user friendly plans. Because the new players know they can capture a significant market by offering user friendly plans which the current ISP are not doing. To be honest if I were a monopoly ISP I would not resort to service restrictions for all customers and risk losing market share.

Multiple stakeholders with vested interests are spreading misinformation about what will happen after death of net neutrality and how it is bad for consumers, when in fact it is the opposite. They are trying to paint ISP's are inherently evil corporations who enjoy tormenting customers when in fact they are for profit organizations who only look for their profits while making any business decision, just like any other capitalist corporation. Being for profit does not necessarily mean being greedy or being evil.

""You have issues confused. There are shitty regulations that do prevent smaller ISPs from bringing competition to the infrastructure / ISP market. These are a mix of both federal and local regulations that have granted the big telcos virtual monopolies in various areas of the country.
That has nothing to do with Net Neutrality.
Net Neutrality is simply the idea that an ISP cannot manipulate the data they are delivering through your connection. If you pay for X bandwidth, you can then access all of the internet at that bandwidth.
Removing Net Neutrality will do absolutely nothing to make the telco industry a ""free market"". It will only allow the big telcos to take full advantage of their monopolies.

It isn't inconceivable to to think that with the advent of so many people cutting the cable that these companies will start to seek out that lost chunk of profit elsewhere. ","The argument that repealing net neutrality will just maintain the status quo ignores the reasons why net neutrality was formalized in the first place: namely, the big ISP conglomerates were buying up media companies and were openly positioning themselves to become the primary seller of media to their subscribers. Additionally, it ignores the impact that cord cutting from increased competition via streaming services has had on companies like Comcast and Time Warner. Net neutrality preserved the environment necessary for competition to develop in the marketplace and it has been a massive boon for consumers. Without it, telecom giants will be permitted to stifle innovation with impunity whenever some entrepreneur threatens their business model.

From what I can tell this all happened because ISPs lobbied (read: bribed) your politicians to repeal the rules protecting net neutrality.","I hope net neutrality goes away just because of this.","One thing we've done in my political activism group is to take it to social media. Most Reps and Senators Facebook, Twitter, etc. Say publicly on their page/feed/whatever that you tried to contact them about supporting Net Neutrality but you couldn't get through.

If you get no response or even a denial, take it to media outlets. Many local newspaper and tv reporters have Facebook and Twitter, too. In my city the major newspaper has some reporters on Twitter who are eager to jump on leads for local politics stories.

Imagine a bus company. You use a bus provided by acmebus to commute to generictown an hour a day each day. 

You've never had a problem and you pay your fare and the journey takes an hour to get you there. No problem, you're getting to where you need to be and the bus firm gets your fare in return. Acmebus are making money and everyone is happy.

Megacity, is able to do this and wants to attract more commuters so pays more to acmebus than generictown can so that people can get to megacity quicker.

Meanwhile, generictown where you work can't afford to do that, so your journey goes from one hour to two hours.

You're still paying the same fare. Now you feel like you've been conned because acmebus is still making money on your fare, your journey takes longer and generictown will always take longer because acmebus are always driving at half the speed limit.

I'm going to say though- when politicians and corporations start foaming at the mouth for something in America they usually get it. Take a look at many major pieces of legislation since 9/11, the repeal of Glass-Steagal etc. Where theres money theres a way.

","To be fair to people against net neutrality, a big reason for their opposition to net neutrality is because ISPs only have so much infrastructure and huge websites with data-heavy content - like HD pictures, videos, and especially video streaming - eat up a lot of bandwidth that effects an ISP's entire infrastructure for everyone.  A big reason websites like Reddit want net neutrality is not because there's a reason or precedent to suggest that ISPs will lord their services over individual citizens (andm in fact, the Progressive Policy Institute - a left-wing public think tank - showed that nowadays most Americans have access to well more than one broadband service provider, so the notion that so much of the country relies on a single service provider is false), but because it protects them from being charged extra for all the bandwidth they hog.

By allowing for tiered services, they can charge big bandwidth companies more for all the bandwidth they use at the expense of everyone else.  The argument then follows that ISPs can use this money to expand their infrastructure and improve services, which is something ISPs in the USA have been doing a lot for the past decade.

>net neutrality","It was well known before 2015 that you could get faster service to a lot of sites like Youtube if you connected via a VPN, because then the ISPs didn't have the packet-level intelligence about what service/site you were actually using. Considering that VPNs add the overhead of TLS/SSL encryption, you would have expected the throughput to be significantly *worse* using a VPN. This implicitly demonstrated that these companies were discriminating against certain traffic flows (because if the lack of 'throughput' was actually real, it would have still been demonstrable using the VPN - or they just can't properly configure rate-shaping).

I work at a company that manufactures full-proxy network intelligence devices and trust me, its trivial to do a lot of shady shit to people's internet. A good example is that its pretty trivial to determine if a customer is attempting to visit speedtest.net and let them go full-speed, yet throttle access to anything else. How would you know your 'real' throughput then?","This is not a credible justification for eliminating net neutrality given that there are more effective, efficient solutions to the problems that are fairer to consumers without opening the door to anti-competitive practices. The way to address bandwidth hogs is to go after the bandwidth hogging users themselves with tiered data caps and speeds. Ultimately, if ISPs start charging companies like Netflix and Amazon, the costs will just be passed onto consumers anyway, but with data caps rather than ISP-end gatekeeping, I don’t have to pay $60 a month for Netflix to subsidize people who watch it 16 hours per day (compared to my 1 or 2). Additionally, we don’t end up burdening tech entrepreneurs with new start-up costs while opening the door to sweetheart deals designed to kill competition to established players like Netflix.

However, these more consumer and entrepreneur-friendly practices are already permitted which is why you should be deeply skeptical about telecom giant claims that they just want help paying for infrastructure. The assertion that it’s Netflix “hogging bandwidth” as opposed to Netflix users, in particular, is just a silly and transparently disingenuous bit of misdirection. Businesses aren’t evil, but they will naturally pursue the most profitable business practices that the law allows. It’s insane to knowingly create an environment conducive to monopolization (or oligopolization) and rent-seeking. It’s also important to keep in mind that a free market is, by definition, one free from price-fixing by both the government and private monopolies/oligopolies. The notion that rules designed to preserve competition are anti-free market is a perversion of the concept.

The argument that most consumers have a choice is also disingenuous given that the choices are typically between the same two telecom giants. A Comcast/AT&T oligopoly is little better than a monopoly of either. I think there would be a more reasonable case for eliminating net neutrality if there was a nationwide abundance of independent telecom companies, and while that might happen, it hasn’t happened yet.

Honestly, this anti-net neutrality argument just seems like the best rationalization from people who don’t want to call out their own party on bad policy, but we have to be better than that.","Govt regs create monopolies and box out new competitors from entering the market thus limiting the potential options & value for consumers. All the fear mongering about gutting net neutrality never occurred for the 20 years before it when we never had it. In fact, the internet has been the greatest bastion of freedom of the 21st century because of the lack of govt regulation. ","You really should consider reading what is actually going on before you hate on ppl who wants to have thier internet free from bullshit.","Shoehorn politics? Please. You can pretend that we don't live in the 21st century, but we do. The reality is that the vast majority of information available today is available through the internet. It's not 1920.

So customers have little to no choice.","You'd expect a forum that is book focused to be empathetic to the communicating of information.

","Alright, fair enough, but I'm not 100% sure what you mean. You want an expansion or change to the current Net Neutrality laws - laws forcing Google and Facebook to change their rules for what content appears to users? 

Do you mean you have an issue with, say, Google's algorithm which favors one result over another and displays it to the user in a more prominent position? Well, Google is a private company whose service you utilize at your pleasure; their product is generally an extremely accurate and pertinent answer to your query. 

Besides, that you perceive Google as ""arbitrarily"" altering your search results has nothing to do with what net neutrality is really about. NN puts the availability of content into the hands of the ISPs, and while I do not think that Comcast or Verizon will start charging people for YouTube or Reddit (I think that's an alarmist view), I really don't see any good reason to give that power back to the ISPs. They'll continue to innovate and give us competitive rates because, in capitalism, it's in their best interest to do so... we just don't give them any more power over content than they need. 

PS: If you do have more information/links about what you think is wrong with the internet and how content is being utilized and presented to us, esp. by sites like FB and Google, I'd like to see where you get your ideas. I am always interested in a civil and productive exchange of information and thoughts. I just implore you to really consider your support of the appeal of this legislation because it seems like the freedom of information is something that benefits and interests you, and this has the possibility of hampering that. Its only a partisan issue if we make it so...","Bandwidth doesn't work that way. 

Each customer is allotted a slice of bandwidth according to the physical infrastructure which is sold to them at a particular price and speed. The traffic transported over that is already paid for at that point in the relationship. It isn't the ISPs business to pick and choose which websites I can and can't visit and at what speed I can do so any more than it is Shell or Texacos right to state where I can drive using their gasoline and at what speed I can drive.

The incentive for the ISPs is in receiving money for providing a service. Just as they have *successfully* been doing since the inception of the ISP.

Let me provide you with some stock histories for backdrop here.

Verizon: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VZ/ select max, look at the trend. Largely been trending upwards since 1985 (dot com bust and recession excepted)
AT & T https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T/ select max, look at the trend. Largely been trending upwards since 1985 (dot com bust and recession excepted)
Charter https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHTR/ Select max, look at the trend. Largely been trending upwards since 2010 (when they floated)
Comcast https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA/ Select max, look at the trend. Largely been trending upwards since 1980.

During those years, the kind of practices that net neutrality prevents were not actively pursued by ISPs. I'd hardly call record high stocks as a lack of incentive. So your argument there really is a straw man.

Your second question is dependent on the answer to your first being that ISPs will not survive with net neutrality in place, which is demonstrably false.

You're also confusing who the customer is. Google, Netflix et al are not the customer. The customer is the person paying for the service. The ISPs don't get to double dip just because they want to quadruple profits at the expense of other companies and their customers.

It's like having someone listen in on your phone call with your brother/sister/mother/father/etc and then charge you more because they're a preferred contact. It makes no sense that they should do this. Now, again, its a combined issue with lack of competition, because capitalism is all about seizing opportunity.

As a result, in many cases all you have is piggy-back ISPs as your alternative. If any. ","Fair enough. I suggest you look up the history of ISPs in north america. Basically, they don't compete with each other. They're divided geographically and where they overlap they try to reach an equilibrium. No one carrier is better than the other (if you even have a choice). Competition is good for consumers, but bad for business (them). There are so few carriers (there are lots of piggy-backs that don't own anything) that they all just circle jerk each other. No new companies can be created because it is too difficult to enter the market (e.g., infrastructure costs, maybe some policy/politicians that have their hands in the ISP pocket making it harder too). It takes a company like Google to push something like google fiber, and I'm sure they'll tell you that its an uphill battle even for them.   
While not technically a 'monopoly'. It's pretty darn close. The last thing they need is a way to make more money off consumers (or businesses)   
If I knew that new ISPs could come in and steal business away if the current ones pushed things too far, I wouldn't be worried. That's a major part of the problem though. You don't get new carriers. There is no competition. Net Neutrality is one of the only things holding back what is essentially a runaway freight train.   
Thinking about that now, that's probably why they're doing this. Their profits are probably plateauing and the only way to make even more money would be to either milk people/businesses or actually try competing with each other.

","In the mainstream language, ""VPN"" refers to ""paid service that proxies your connections"", so it's easy for a censoring entity to block access to those because the domain names of said VPN services are a single point of failure (everything is centralize).

In computer parlance, VPN is a protocol that is implemented between two systems that want to create a private encrypted network, so if you want to use one of those, rent a VPS somewhere abroad (OVH, Online etc), install/configure `openvpn` on it, and you're good to go. In theory this is block-able (China does it), in practice you should be good to go if you fly under the radar and don't try to turn your thing into profit. After all, there are many legitimate uses of encrypted connections (such as an employee connecting to their company's network remotely), so there's no reason to blanket-ban those.

The problem with this FCC thing is that networks are already given priority according to how much they pay (big background ""networks"" that synchronize entire ISPs), so this is just a lame extension of an already existing pay-per-bandwidth rule onto customers (beyond the ISPs' scope).

Daily updates, cancellations, reminders, etc. are mediated via the internet and email. Google Calendars, which synchronize meetings, requires internet access.

I do my banking almost entirely online. I can check balances online, pay bills online, and deposit checks with my phone's camera. This is my personal version, but businesses do versions of this on the scale of millions of dollars daily. That keeps the economy going.

What HASN'T changed?","Off the top of my head, lots of bank branches have closed because of the heavy use of online banking. And the ones that are open are open when most people are at work. A lot of businesses don't give paper checks anymore. Money is auto deposited into your account and an stub is emailed to you. How many people are taking online courses for high school and college these days?
Just because there was a time when everything could be done without the internet doesn't mean it still can. Because of the prevalence of internet use, a lot of things have evolved to where most people need access to navigate major portions of their life. That's just common sense. ","Emailing. Networking with employers or coworkers. Selling goods. I mean...the internet is like, a communication/business/work ""tool."" There's TOO MUCH you need from it now, if anything.

You use it to do homework. To reach out to potential employers. Hell, if you have a computer science degree and your job requires you to code...for a website....can you honestly tell that person to not use the internet?

Also, online buying/selling. E-Commerce is a real thing. It's the reason why Netflix and Hulu are big, and Blockbuster is out of business. Cable TV isn't the only way to watch video media anymore. Same reason why Amazon is successful, and Sears is on its way out. The average up-time by company websites a long time ago used to be something around 70-80% (the missing percent is when there's too much traffic and/or routine maintenance). Thing is that kind of policy doesn't fly now; I don't have the exact percent, but most uptime *needs* to be near-constant nowadays. That's why DDoS attacks and such on servers are a real problem for companies if/when it happens.

Everything's just *on* the internet now. Yeah, ok maybe Facebook and Reddit may be something we can do without. But there's a lot of essential things you need to just function and/or be competitive. I mean...for example, it's basically imperative to have a LinkedIn profile if you want to build a good network. Most people won't physically mail you about jobs, and they're not gonna call and give you a ""heads-up"" on the phone interview ^(because it's in the email).

Also, to find out about these jobs in the first place, you kinda need to look at the company's website. Long gone are the days of finding job openings in the local newspapers. Sure, there might be some that still bother. Hell, let's raise the ante and say that there are ""many"" that still do. Well I can bet that there's A LOT more job postings listed on the web. What you said about not needing internet might've been viable maybe 10 years ago. Maybe. But definitely not now. ^(I'd personally wager that it's already encroached into our lives even way back then.)","Do you think humans should have a right to food, shelter, and clean water? 

""Rights"" are just something a society thinks all humans should be provided with, as a baseline. Because if they're denied those basic rights, whatever they are, everyone is worse off for it. Requiring your population have the basic essentials to survive and thrive is a pretty core element to functional human society. The internet didn't use to be part of that. Neither did indoor plumbing or electricity. But at a certain point, ubiquitous technologies become mandatory to function in a society. ","Conservative governments have always tried to push us more toward a US-like system though.","ISP's are not your enemy.  They are providing you internet access when no one else in the world will.

And before THAT, we didn't have the internet on a public scale. Are you serious right now? Are you in favor of this?","To be honest, they probably won't do it in the near future. What they'll probably do is start charging the sites that generate the most bandwidth, or they'll render it unusable. In fact, this is what happened with Netflix a few months ago. A lot of large sites will be able to handle it, but they'll probably raise rates or start charging for things that are free to make up the losses. Then just like they did with data caps, you'll one day hear about an ISP trying out charging for specific sites in certain areas. Then one day, you'll hear some announcement that they're rolling it out nationwide and some bullshit about how it's going to save you money, but they wouldn't fight this hard for something that isn't going to make them just fuck loads of money. The day net neturality is repealed, I'm willing to bet you'll see stocks surge for every ISP. ","Cause they couldn’t before, because of net neutrality? They used to not charge for “first day DLC content” (aka content that should come with the game but they want more money), but now they do. The answer is simple: money. You WILL pay more, it’s not a matter of if, it is when.","That was befpre internet was a central part of infrastructure.

Net neutrality didnt come about in 2015, it was *clarified* in that year. As a principle it had been around since early 00's.","Bingo. net neutrality... biggest nothing burger of 2015-2017.","This guy is either a troll or completely thick.

Again, another situation where rich and powerful people didn't want to share and took advantage of their people. I do not think anyone would disagree with your examples, actually. Nestle has a right to the water they sell you. Unless the world runs out of water, there are still plenty of ways for humans to get their basic needs. Same goes for your carrots. Those are yours and yours alone. Neither the government nor your neighbor can take those from you. That would be akin to communism. Americans do not like communism. However, we generally don't like monopolies either and I can not really tell you why so many companies get away with having monopolies (like we see with our ISP's). My first guess is they have a lot of money, people like money and we keep voting in people to office who will take that money.

That said, the argument here is whether the internet should be considered a utility. Is it, at this current point in time, a basic human right? I believe so and here is why: the internet represents capitalism and the American ideal almost to the purest extent I can imagine. We have nearly unlimited access to information where we agree with website owners how we wish to ""pay"" for that information. Sometimes it is truly free information. If we were to censor or give a company power over censorship we could see a situation like China where the American people are only allowed to see what the government or the ISP believes we should see. This is blatant manipulation and believe me, we can ALL be manipulated. There are scores of psychologists who could probably tell you what you will do tomorrow, what you want to buy but can't afford but will buy anyways and what you will likely be doing in ten years just by browsing your Facebook. 

That, to me, is terrifying. Censoring, in any way, ease of access information also increases to a ""poor people's tax"" because even if I can afford to pay more for the whole package of internet, poor Joe Blow doesn't even have a car. In this day and age, most of us actually do need technology to help us achieve the American Dream (which really just means live comfortably). There are plenty of people in my city who I speak to at the library who don't even have internet now. Regardless, there they are at the library, a public service which we all pay for whether we use it or not, trying to better themselves by applying for jobs, taking online classes, etc.

You are correct, however, that if I have a right to something, someone usually has to provide it for me. This is why we have government. It is what we call a social contract. We agree to be governed SO LONG AS the government provides us with our unalienable rights (example: don't fuck with my pursuit of happiness). In return, we won't break out the guillotines like those French guys and we won't throw your tea in the Ocean like we did with those Brits and we will keep paying taxes. But it's a two way street.

Correct me if I am wrong.

It ensures that we can educate each other fairly and without censorship so that one day we might create a Utopia! Government is just a collection of people that we choose may govern us, but again, they must supply us with our unalienable rights. We are arguing that the internet is a basic human right (that is to say, the removal of the internet in whole or in part would inhibit or natural right to the Pursuit of Happiness). No one is demanding anything. It is a fair trade. This is outlined in the social contract that makes up our country. It is quite literally a deal! Otherwise we would have anarchy, which may or may not be better for us. But history has certainly shown anarchism doesn't work so well. We also do not keep most citizens from leaving the country if they cannot agree to be governed by our set of rules. No one forces anyone to be American. So long as you stay true to the social contract (be a decent human being), you're free to come or go. There is a lot of paperwork though.

You've brought up some really good ideas. You're thinking, and I respect that. Unfortunately I really am tired! Look up John Locke if you have time. Also, Albert Camus is cool. For a fictional approach, Kurt Vonnegut is the shit. Also, Jack Kerouac might be right up your alley. You seem like a bright young guy. Keep your head open to alternative ideas! Society isn't all that bad, I promise. Growing old sucks though.","No, that means I can get assigned a cheap apartment per say. It's much smaller than your house and I don't own it either. I am just renting the apartment. You're bound by constitutional law here in Denmark to have a place to live etc. 

It is still the government who supplies it through a program and then all the different services in the area, depending which one is able to hook you up. Why is that so hard to fathom?","Then the person who had to work to pay for the construction/maintenance of roads is the slave? Repeat for public teachers, government jobs, etc.

You are on this weird libertarian rant thing without understanding the underlying societal contracts holding society together.

The alternative, a world where you only get legal representation, a fair trial, provided you can afford it, is so fucked up, I couldnt even begin to imagine it.","Walmart and Target compete selling clothes and food.  If the prices at Target get to high people go to Walmart.  If the prices at Walmart get too high people go to Target.  Imagine if Walmart suddenly started building multi-billion dollar Jet fighters and Tanks while still trying to compete with Target for customers.  How are they going to pay for that?  They going to raise the prices on Fruit of the Loom underwear?  Everyone is going to buy their underwear at Target and Walmart is going to lose money.  Not to mention customers might start to wonder why Walmart started building JET FIGHTERS?  That if Walmart started building WEAPONS OF WAR it might TURN OFF CUSTOMERS and they'd go bankrupt?  

The difference between Walmart and Government is nobody assumes Walmart has a right to rule over them.  ","Never experienced it. But sure, the two nobody’s who claim it happened 5 years ago are surely empirical.

I defend equality. Don’t pretend like ISP’s are magically different than mobile networks and ignore the evidence of the two decades without net neutrality. Just believe the mouth pieces who spout hypothetical situations. That makes total sense. ","So I should believe the guy who made up a doomsday scenario over a provable and documented history and current market without net neutrality. 

Yeah, that’s totally logical.","> If you love the way cable companies run your TV so much then that’s your opinion

Love has nothing to do with it.  If I don't like the service my cable company is providing then i'll opt out of that service.  (Something you can't do with government by the way.  If you try to opt out of a government ""service"" government will throw you in a rape cage.)   What I won't do is plead to a politician to THREATEN my cable company to bend to my opinion or get shut down.  This is called freedom.

> the infrastructure put in place to allow the internet to even exist was paid for by tax dollars
> companies are heavily subsidized using your money

Dubious claim.  My ISP is funded privately but you want to threaten them with your demands just the same.  

In any case it's totally irrelevant if they do receive tax dollars.  The tax dollars were extorted from me via threats of violence.  If the mafia extorted me and gave you the money I would have NO beef with YOU.  My beef is with the Mafia.
","So, we're just going to... What? Pretend that there aren't corporations that have an obscene profit margin that such spending wouldn't affect their viability dramatically, that corporations are always so forthright and honest that we'll definitely know all about what projects the executives of these companies are funding and running in other countries, even after you've gotten rid of the only groups with any amount of power and any reason to try to prevent this?

Or, even at the most basic level. What do you think the military would do if you removed the government from it? What do you think arms manufacturers are going to do with their factories and materials? Will PMCs just decide to shut down now that governments aren't their clients? Do you really think that your entirely imaginary 'true free market' is going to save you from the groups that are already armed or able to produce arms deciding to make the most of no longer having any opposition to violent takeover?","Yeah and Walmarts and Targets never ending quest for lower priced clothing leads to them using children to make the clothes.

But then I'm guessing it's evil if a government tried to step in and protect the children being made work, right?","Again, if supposedly nothing will change, these giants wouldn't waste their money taking it down. Literally the only reason they would is if it is in their interest to begin NOT treating data equally. You can't say you defend equality if you believe that data should be censored or restricted if it comes from someone your ISP doesn't like. Which is what removing net neutrality allows. So explain, what is bad about net neutrality? Since so far the only thing you have said is ""It wasn't too bad in the past, so it won't change much"" which is not a reason to remove a law.","""Doomsday scenario"" is nothing I suggested, first of all. But maybe you could bother yourself with looking at places like Portugal for what it will look like.

You think nothing will change? Then why on earth would these companies be using millions of dollars trying to make sure Net Neutrality is taken down? Hint: They wouldn't unless it would stand to explicitly benefit them.","The plan is to roll back net neutrality so those big companies with army of lawyers and infrastructure to have more power. So what limits small companies; more power to big companies or laws that help small businesses and the people? If the regulation is to protect the people (which this is) and there are clauses that specifically allow for small businesses to compete, NO it doesnt. Stop trying to confuse people dude. I will make sure to inform everyone I know now.","Highest taxation in the world, aka it goes through TAXES. Safety nets. You're still paying it with the money, you got from the government. It's not free in that sense, if you're thinking that.

People work. Government takes a cut of your pay. Those money goes to stuff like that. Do I need to cut it out even more? ","Net neutrality prevents company incentives like packaging extra services for free. You know, like what happens in mobile. That doesn’t exist right.

Mobile networks sure do censor and restrict access don’t they? Wait, no they don’t.","Literally not arguing if government censorship possible nor bad. I'm saying getting rid of NN can lead to censorship, as private institutions can also censor content. 

Right now all is equal access. ","Great story.  Where did you learn that?  12 years of government funded school perhaps?  Imagine what you would learn about Walmart if Walmart funded 12 years of your schooling.  Someday people will evolve past thinking that they need to threaten otherwise peaceful people with rape cages ""for their own protection"".  But it won't start with you.  It's the opposite of civilized behavior.","It's called taxes. So everyone who pays taxes are slaves? What kind of fairy tale land do you live in? Do you really think that all the taxes only goes to that? No. 

Free education(Something you severely lack, no joke), free healthcare, paid maternity leave, free government assistance if you're very sick, otherwise you might have to work a bit to get your pay. The list goes on of benefits.

But still, all those things in taxes are going to a good thing, and that's why people don't die in the streets or go mentally insane here. We treat people well if they are having a hard time, and 99% of Denmark is happy to keep it that way.","> Walmart

Government funds public schools.  Do you think a government funded school is going to educate it's students about alternatives to government?  If Walmart were funding schools do you think Walmart would teach it's students that shopping at Target might be a good alternative?

>  You also misuse evolve.

No.  I didn't.  I believe there is something physically wrong with people who feel that otherwise peaceful people need to be threatened with rape cages in order to have a civilized society.  Something so sociopathic that it has to be physical and only a physical evolution of the brain could change those demented thought processes.  People like you seem physically compelled to be ruled.  By a Senator, a President, a Chief.  Or you wouldn't know what to do with yourself.  You wouldn't know how to run your own life.  You'd have no idea how to voluntarily and peacefully collaborate to get the things that you want.  No.  People like you seem to have some physical disability causing this intense fear of chaos unless we be ruled over like some tribe of chimpanzees.  I believe only evolution can save the chimpanzees.  They will never think their way out.

> You also didnt provide an example of a society that is decently large that exists without taxation.

I would point you to early U.S.A.  Before 1913 there was no income tax.  Before that there was no federal tax.  There were schools, roads, etc.  All the things you fear to lose so much that you're willing to threaten peaceful people with rape cages to have them.  There are other examples as well.  But thats completely beside the point.  Only a very limited mind would think that if something doesn't exist then it could never or will never exist.   Your expressed viewpoint ignores every single social and technological advancement of human kind.  ","But they are free to use those services too, you know. They are not allowed not to. What exactly are you trying to get here? You can go tax-free, but then you cannot get government benefits etc. So you basically want me to say ""Oh, we're all slaves""? It's mutual benefaction. You work, society makes sure if you fall ill etc that you're not gonna die on the streets.

Yea, I'm a paramedic. That requires a high education, and it was all free - now I can ""pay"" it back by being a productive member of society, and I am happy to do so! ","Examples of companies making bad decisions and turning them over the next day or week? Wow, so convincing.

Not that hasn’t happened DURING net neutrality with ISP’s.","Why do you need more arguments when you won't even address the one's I presented? Do you see how that works?

1. It wasn't bad before, nothing will change now.

2. Mobile networks have always been this way and look nothing like the doomsday scenario being proposed.

3. Net Neutrality prevents market incentives, bundle services similar to cable tv, 

4. Net Neutrality is unfair to ISP's since mobile networks aren't bound by the same rules and service providers are not held to the same standard.

5. Net Neutrality in totality doesn't really matter one way or another. The market has ALWAYS self corrected. Codifying more power to the FCC is a bad move since bad actors to turn that against the population. Less regulation is better.","You say nothing will change, then immediately imply it will (see: ""bundle services similar to cable tv""), proceed to imply mobile data is the same as wired (which it isn't even close, which is clear), and claim markets self correct, which is also bullshit, (see: the late 1800s in the US, perhaps the most corrupt and greed driven time in the country's history, and the closest to free market (as is claimed by one of, if not the, most notable capitalist websites and organizations). 

And defending mobile networks when more shady stuff comes out non-stop about them? That is funny.

All in all, it is clear not only are you completely mislead on most facts relating to net neutrality, your arguments cannot even agree with themselves, and your obvious lack of knowledge regarding markets and history betrays you. 

So, dare I say it, for hopefully the last time, goodbye!"
