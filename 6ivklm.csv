"Ugh.  ""This could be as big as SOPA""

Why is it not **BIGGER**?  I don't understand why more companies participate.  Okay, they'll lose money, is that not short sighted?  Will a short blackout or banner advertisement really cost you money vs guaranteeing you'll never be shook down by an ISP to deliver your content.

Seems like a no brainer for me.  Shut this shit down.  All of it.  If you are a video streaming site, force all videos to start at the lowest possible resolution and require a waiting period of *x* seconds before stopping the video, popping up a banner, then allowing them to reselect a higher resolution.  When they select a higher resolution, it should tell them that in the future, this might cost you money, link to the FCC.  Youtube should do this all week long, as should netflix.  Shove it down our throats until the public cares.","Tbh if Google would join and black out all search results. Internet traffic would plumed and people would actually care.","I feel like if they really cared it would be a week of action.  Could you imagine the economic impact if the Internet was slowed to a crawl for an entire week?  This would be over.

Sort of like what you've got already, but it's not a pop up, and that's all you can get for like a few hours or even the whole day.

Imagine how big of a splash it would make if Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, and all these other HUGE websites all just stop working all at once. That would get people's attention.

If you take a look at all the the top shareholders you can easily see the Monopoly on all of the ISPs. I argue that getting rid of Net Neutrality when the ISPs are owned by all the same corporations and banks is a clear violation of American Anti Trust Acts;
-The Clayton Act of 1914
-The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914
-The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914

All of these laws were passed to protect us, the consumer from the formation of Monopoly cartels and other collusive practices regarded as being in restraint of trade.

If you doubt my findings look up all the shareholders of the ISP's and see for yourself, most of the information can be found on the NASDAQ.

    Number one there was no problem to solve, the internet wasn’t broken in 2015. In that situation, it doesn’t seem me that preemptive market-wide regulation is necessary. Number two, even if there was a problem, this wasn’t the right solution to adopt. These Title II regulations were inspired during the Great Depression to regulate Ma Bell which was a telephone monopoly. And the broadband market we have is very different from the telephone market of 1934. So, it seems to me that if you have 4,462 internet service providers and if a few of them are behaving in a way that is anticompetitive or otherwise bad for consumer welfare then you take targeted action to deal with that. You don’t declare the entire market anticompetitive and treat everyone as if they are a monopolist.

Hmm, I wonder what that means?

For the benefit of any other readers who may see this, /r/Helios337 is pointing out that it *was* an actual illegal power grab by the *previous administration's FCC* back in 2010, that dragged through the courts until being [finally ruled illegal in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014\)). That FCC had to go back to the drawing board and to rework the power grab and this time the courts let it stand, so now Congress has to correct it.

The current FCC supports Congress in returning to a free internet that's not subject to FCC's self-authorized regulation. People here want Trump's FCC to have the power the regulate the internet, which I find disturbing and surprising.
","Oh exactly. We all grew up with a free internet. The FCC did not have authority over the internet, and people took the openness and freedom of the internet for granted, and even talked about how the fact that it couldn't be censored would change the world. Really, it can't be censored? Ask folks in China whether the Internet can be censored...

If the FCC's regulatory power grab is allowed to stand, it's just a matter of time before the FCC uses the current scare of the day (terrorism? child pornography? drugs?) to justify censoring websites just as they do to radio and TV.
","Well I disagree with a lot of your post as well.

> Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. 

No. Net Neutrality has nothing to do with law or enforcement. It is the principle of treating all the data the same. That can be done with or without regulation that mandates it.

> Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

Title II is the **current** legal framework for net neutrality. Doesn't mean it's required to enforce NN. Also you don't discuss what other privileges Title II has given to the FCC. You make no effort to actually describe what Title II actually is. And considering that is the actual law that is being potentially removed, I think it's important to do so.

You also make an extreme claim that basically the only reason to oppose such regulation is because of the Cable Lobby. It's an attempt to dismiss any opposition view as nothing more than either corruption or being misinformed from a corrupt force.

> The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer

And Tom Wheeler, the ""savior for Net Neutrality"", was a cable TV lobbyist. Do you remember the fear mongering when he was choosen? I do. Reddit and the media was pathetic in regards to it. The only reason to include this statement is to fear monger.

> and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. 

And those that want to keep it contribute to misleading the public as well. That's what politics has become.

> ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. 

""Slow lanes"" has only applied to Netflix, and im still fuzzy on if that event has to do with NN as I heard varying reports. The other situations are completely fabricated fear mongering that ISPs have shown no desire to do. 

> The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. 

Again, its all the cable lobbys fault. No reason to oppose it otherwise, right? I'm a supporter, but I still acknowledge there are logical reasons to oppose Title II.

BUT TO ADDRESS THE WEBSITE...

> So they can control what we see and do online

Umm, source? Anything to back that claim?

> Tax the internet

Only the government can lay taxes. And we have the Internet Tax Freedom Act that prevents it happening on the internet. ""Tax"" is a buzz word the site is using to fear monger with.

> If we lose net neutrality, the internet will never be the same.

We've gone *years* without Net Neutrality being enforced. Its simply a practice that has been upheld by ISPs through the years. Most ISPs don't oppose Net Neutrality, since they practice it anyway, they oppose Title II and the power to lay further regulations that comes with it.

....

We can't have a discussion on the **actual** debate (Title II, not NN), because that would demand actually acknowledging the opposition. Its easier to just call them idiots.

Yeah I dunno
","Look, I'll maybe try to reply in more detail later, but here's the thing: you don't understand economics, and, yes, Title II is monopolization. Just because state-daddy has more concentrated control does not mean its decisions will be best. The state is not magic. It practically ensures that the best decisions *won't* be arrived at because it'll be more politicized and provides more opportunities for regulatory capture.

> possibly Obama

Again, not ""possibly."" He was outspoken on the topic. To the point where Trump directly attacked him over it. He called Net Neutrality an Obama conspiracy to censor conservative views online. 

Like I said, this is a partisan issue that both sides have been outspoken about. No need for false dichotomies. ","Ok, since we were talking about net neutrality, and because the majority of Reddit users are American I figured putting things in the context of America was relevant (and yes I realize that American net neutrality affects the rest of the world or whatever)","Because Amazon still has to go through ISPs to get to users.

So your problems is with my solution rather than what my solution is trying to achieve?

Even though I covered that in the comment ""That's just one idea, but I think we should work with the idea of protecting kids from toxic porn not against it, there could be other better ideas out there""


Do ISP block sites that don't warn about adult content? Can post a link? 

tbh I think your problem is with someone else been openly creative, you resent it  probably cause you feel you have creative potential that isn't being recognised, and you cast hatred on to other people's creativity cause you're bitter and jealous",">Forgot this other bit?

Nope it's right there.

>Nobody would be regulating them, but they would be regulating the Internet

No one owns the Internet. You can block access to sites, but you risk losing business to competition.

>especially considering many of them are under monopolies 

Government enforced monopolies. ","The only large platform they'd be able to buy is Twitter, Facebook and Google own most of the other top social media platforms. 

Honestly, I can't see Comcast buying Twitter, that's a money sink I don't see anyone bothering with. Twitter just doesn't seem to have a way of monetizing their services enough to become profitable. 

Edit: Verizon already owns Tumblr, so I guess they could pimp it out... ","Thank you for your opinion. I just think they are not equipped to do this.

It's like Jill Stein supporters supporting Trump because they don't like Hillary's stance on Environment. ","I think the only people it serves to pretend it's a partisan issue is the ISPs and Ajit. I'm a conservative on all issues, and this is one of them. Hillary failed the test of believability just as much as Trump does.

Of course you're gonna come at me with Russia etc... whatever I don't really wanna have this debate.

Lets just both agree it's more helpful to educate everyone on how NN is good, and not tell half of the US they're on the wrong side of something before they even know what it is. (Which is what you're (un?)intentionally doing by calling it partisan before most of the US really understands it.)","This means DPI (deep packet inspection:black boxes) everywhere, i'm pretty sure ISP will fight this because this is going to be really expensive for them, and for govs.

It absolutely is.

> The government has given ISPs monopolies. I literally can't get any other ISP because they legally can't come where I live.
How does NN enforce these monopolies?

Regulation in general forces companies to adjust to the market. Government regulation is artificial and doesn't necessarily come at the demand of the market. This government regulation comes at the whim of unelected government officials and their financial backers and increases the scope of power of the FCC.

>And you want them LESS accountable?

No, I want a free market to keep internet providers accountable to their customers. 

>That has nothing to do with NN.

It has everything to do with it. 

>You don't know what NN does then, and I'm going to assume you don't even live in America because you know so fucking little about how our inet infrastructure works.

But I do. And I do. And I know what how it works, yes. Ironic considering you're advocating for restricting markets and expressed a dislike for monopolized corporations. ","They are unnecessary because pretty much everything you've said already exists. I don't have time to link to everything, but I will say a few things. 

RTA (restricted to adults) labeling is voluntary but already exists. You could probably find stats on how often it's used (i don't know right now). Or, you could probably even go to top porn sites and view their source code if you were so inclined. 

.xxx domain also exists, which could help for something like this.

Software to protect kids from adult content already exists (pretty sure it's built into windows).

The Internet service provider provides Internet to a household run by an adult and is being paid by an adult. I don't think they need to do more than they are. It is a parent's responsibility to keep their children safe online, and its already been made easy. 

My point is that the help is out there already and this isn't related to net neutrality. Besides, in my opinion, if a child has access to porn, there are probably bigger issues in their life.",">Government enforced monopolies.


Didn't say everything the government does is good. And the reason they likely did that is because they're under corporate control, like why this situation is happening in the first place with Net Neutrality.

>No one owns the Internet. You can block access to sites, but you risk losing business to competition.

Yeah they own the Internet, via the pipeways, when it comes to area they cover. And about the whole ""you risk losing business to competition,"" besides the monopoly, look at consoles, where exclusives are prevalent and there's quality control. Similar thing here. And some ISPs will pay some websites to have them as exclusive to their own service, remember DirectTV with NFL Sunday Ticket?","Net neutrality and busting local monopolies are not the same thing. Both need to happen (and the latter enables the former) but NN isn't why Google can't get permits to lay cable in areas laws exist preventing them from doing so.","It's not pretending. You can look up the votes. When Dems had more power we had Net Neutrality. Now it's being attacked by Republicans. 

Ignoring reality is what got us here. 

>I'm a conservative on all issues, and this is one of them. 

My bad. I thought you were for Net Neutrality. The official conservative stance is against it. 

>Lets just both agree it's more helpful to educate everyone on how NN is good

Democrats are already educated on the issue. You can think that they're lying because of ""feels"" but they're already in favor of Net Neutrality. Conservatives are against it. Maybe you think they're lying too and are secretly for it, but their actions and votes indicate that's not the case. 

I think people who are against Net Neutrality are wrong. You may think they're right or ignorant. Either way, nobody likes being called ignorant. And a lot of conservatives that are against it will tell you that they do know what it is. So good luck convincing them. It's your team so maybe you can speak to them better.

Just don't pretend it's not a partisan issue. ",">Didn't say everything the government does is good. And the reason they likely did that is because they're under corporate control, like why this situation is happening in the first place with Net Neutrality.

I was illustrating that net neutrality only further enforces such corporate and government relationships.

Owning the road doesn't mean you own the cars or the destination of those cars.

> And about the whole ""you risk losing business to competition,"" besides the monopoly, look at consoles, where exclusives are prevalent and there's quality control. Similar thing here.

You think Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo aren't benefiting from regulation?

Yeah, that's true. But I'm not sure what point is being made here.","It really is. It’s much less stressful. I love not being glued to my phone. I wouldn’t consider myself addicted to Reddit, though. I do really like how it’s full of genuinely useful information and how there are so many amazing subreddits out there to explore. It’s kind of like the internet wrapped up into one website, imo.","Well, both are about anti-competitive acts by the same monopolies and duopolies, so while they're not the same, they're indicative of the same motivation.","Oh my lord, this is so wrong. First of all: They can't DDoS anyone ""anonymously"". If there's traffic coming from their IPs, it can and will be traced to them. And don't even think of mentioning a VPN, because then they'd have to find an external VPN that can actually *handle* a DDoS attack by Google.

Second of all: The number of users they have does not matter, and neither does the number of IPs. Why would having more visitors on their site increase their DDoS potency? Why would having more IP addresses? I mean, if they actually have hosts they control on these addresses, sure, but just having more IPs changes nothing.

Third of all, even if they theoretically could DDoS anyone anonymously doesn't mean they would; the risks are simply too high. Could you imagine the media shitstorm that Google of all companies getting caught DDoSing would ensue?","> It has nothing to do with the government censoring you.

Free speech should be defended no matter if it's a consumer or a company.

> Irrelevant.

Not even remotely irrelevant. 

> By making them less accountable?

A corporation with limited competition is more likely to make decisions that hurt their consumer base because they have limited options.

> Learn how to google things.

Right back at you. 

>I'm advocating for restricting companies so they can't fuck over their customers any more than they already do.

Then why aren't you supporting of a free market? Again, ironic. 

> Fuck off.

And this is exactly what political discourse devolves too whenever they're pressed on their stances.  ",">Owning the road doesn't mean you own the cars or the destination of those cars.

But in theory you technically do. If each car is reporting where they're going, you can block where they're going, and push them where you want them to go. Or make them pay at a toll booth for each direction.

>I was illustrating that net neutrality only further enforces such corporate and government relationships.

Except it doesn't. In fact, this goes counter to the whole situation in general, if this was like state government-mandated monopolies, then why are ISPs wanting to pull out of this? Because regulation is killing their potential chances of more profit and power.

>You think Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo aren't benefiting from regulation?

There isn't as much regulation in this territory, and consoles can still rise to compete against them. But there is some, like DMCA.

>Yeah, that's true. But I'm not sure what point is being made here.

That a similar thing can be pulled of by ISPs on certain killer sites.","i've been kinda wary about setting up a permanent discord account, since i'm not sure about whether to trust them enough to hold identifiable data over time. the way i do this now is to stick to larger, open discords and treat it pretty much pseudonymously, like public irc channels. when i want to use it, i make a new account with a throwaway email, and when i close the browser i clear my history and next time i register a new one. doesn't quite enable any social persistance, but fuck it, people are more or less the interchangeable. anonymity is quite nice, it's too bad society mostly doesn't work like that, and that the internet is mostly going in the opposite direction as well.","They can put something in their main web page to query, for example Comcast. The query comes from the user's ip and they get so much traffic Comcast will go down in a few minutes. 

They can assign different ips to servers and then revert them back after the attack. 

Obviously they never would, but they definitely could. ","> But in theory you technically do.

No you don't. Not even in theory. 

> If each car is reporting where they're going, you can block where they're going, and push them where you want them to go. Or make them pay at a toll booth for each direction.

How does that equate to ownership?

>Except it doesn't. In fact, this goes counter to the whole situation in general, if this was like state government-mandated monopolies, then why are ISPs wanting to pull out of this? Because regulation is killing their potential chances of more profit and power.

Quite the opposite. [Comcast is against the title 2 classification, but still in favor of regulation that supports it.](http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/comcast-supports-net-neutrality-and-reversal-of-title-ii-classification-title-ii-is-not-net-neutrality)

Regulation kills competition which increases their chance of more profit and poewr.

> There isn't as much regulation in this territory, and consoles can still rise to compete against them. But there is some, like DMCA.

That is wrong. There is a ton of regulation in consoles, they have to abide by FCC, safety standards, government set industry standards which forces them to cut costs and release subpar products. This is why custom PC's are much more successful and cost effective, however the gaming market is dominated by consoles and mobile devices. 

> That a similar thing can be pulled of by ISPs on certain killer sites.

I still don't know where you're getting at.",">How does that equate to ownership?

Because I was using your road example. You own the road, so generally you do whatever you want with it. And I pointed out issues with that.

>No you don't. Not even in theory.

Explain. Sure you don't literally ""own"" the entire Internet, but you can control your own networks, which are used to serve the entire Internet to consumers, allowing you to control what is shown from the Internet and in what way in territories you have a monopoly in. Technically, they would ""own"" the Internet in areas of influence.

>Quite the opposite. Comcast is against the title 2 classification, but still in favor of regulation that supports it.

>Regulation kills competition which increases their chance of more profit and poewr.

Depends. You're going off as if **ALL** regulation harms. No. Besides that, the FCC has limited various elements of Title II for ISPs by mostly using it to enact Net Neutrality, which actually was pushed in an older form back in 2010, but was taken down because of legal loop-holes that Verizon took advantage of. But even if they put the full Title II into force, various elements were in place for the sake of consumers and extra competition, and isn't built to set up a monopoly. Like leasing infrastructure, which actually would help take down the monopolies in here in the first place.

EDIT: And about Comcast, that's naive to think they really support Net Neutrality. This is the same Comcast that took down a small ISP by literally cheating-- by damaging lines that go to the small ISP's customers.

>That is wrong. There is a ton of regulation in consoles, they have to abide by FCC, safety standards, government set industry standards which forces them to cut costs and release subpar products. This is why custom PC's are much more successful and cost effective, however the gaming market is dominated by consoles and mobile devices.

FCC regulations don't make subpar products. Besides that, custom PCs are comprised of parts that are FCC regulated, which makes your argument have no sense. I know, PC Master Race (I like PC gaming too, think it's the best), but not this. The reason custom PCs are more cost-effective (and actually barely against consoles, custom PCs are close to console-style pricing, more than ever, but not usually better) are because the builder pays part of it by building it themself rather than paying for the labor too. That, and partially due to the lack of Windows often included in the pricing. Consoles are cheap by selling as a loss and/or mass production.

>I still don't know where you're getting at.

Let's say the NFL made a website where all their games are being shown, in a similar ""NFL Sunday Ticket"" style. And they made a deal with AT&T to only have that web service with AT&T users, and to not register with Comcast and others to have it on their ""Internet"" (if you can even call it that at that point) packages. In a very similar way with the example earlier."
